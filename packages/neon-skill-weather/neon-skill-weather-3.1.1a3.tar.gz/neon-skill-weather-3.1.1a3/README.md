## Summary  
  
Get current weather and forecast info.

## Description  
  
This skill provides current weather information at different locations and forecasts up to 5 days.

Use of this skill requires use of third-party APIs. If you do not have access to Neon API servers, you may access the
Alpha Vantage API directly by providing a key in `~/owm.txt`. You can generate an Open Weather Map key
[here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
  
## Examples  

Say `“Hey Neon”` if you are in the wake words mode.
  
- "What is the weather in Los Angeles?"

- "What is the forecast for Friday?"

## Troubleshooting
Try asking for a different location or changing your default location by saying `Neon change my location to Seattle`.
