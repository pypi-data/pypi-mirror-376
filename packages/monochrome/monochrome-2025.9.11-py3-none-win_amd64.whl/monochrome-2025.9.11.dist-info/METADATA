# Monochrome: Viewer for Monochromatic Video Data

Monochrome is a lightweight and fast viewer for scientific imaging and video data with a focus on monochromatic data and high-dynamic range data. It is designed to be fast and lightweight, i.e. it uses memory-mapping to load video files to avoid copying the data into RAM.

![Monochrome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sitic/monochrome/refs/heads/master/assets/Monochrome-screenshot1.webp)

It is designed for viewing high-speed monochromatic fluorescence video data from scientific cameras and meet our specific needs for cardiac optical mapping data (together with [optimap](https://github.com/cardiacvision/optimap)):
* Support for high-dynamic range (uint16, 32-bit float) data with sliders to adjust intensity range
* Playback of multiple videos in sync
* High-speed playback with precise frame-rate control
* Viewing of optical traces (average intensity in a region of interest over time)
* Rendering of layers on top of videos with transparency
* Rendering of point positions over time (e.g. for tracking or optical flow visualization)
* Exporting videos as a sequence of PNG images or MP4 videos with control over frame rate and frame skipping
* Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

It is designed to be fast and lightweight, i.e. it uses memory-mapping to load video files to avoid copying the data into RAM.

## Installation

There are two ways to install Monochrome: as a standalone application and/or with its Python interface through pip.

In the standalone application, supported video files can be loaded by drag & drop them into the window or by associating the file extension with Monochrome to open them with a double-click. The Python interface allows to load and play videos from Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

### Standalone Application

Download the relevant executable (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the latest [release page](https://github.com/sitic/monochrome/releases/latest). See the [installation instructions](https://monochrome.readthedocs.io/latest/installation_standalone/) for details.

### Python Library

The Python library includes all necessary files and does not require the installation of the standalone Monochrome application. Open a terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install monochrome
```

See the [Python installation guide](https://monochrome.readthedocs.io/latest/installation_python/) for further details. To start the viewer in standalone mode, run:
```bash
python -m monochrome
```

See the [tutorial](https://monochrome.readthedocs.io/latest/tutorial/) for an introduction to the Python library, here is a brief overview:

```python
import monochrome as mc
import numpy as np

# Create some video with shape (time, height, width) as a numpy array
video = np.random.rand(500, 256, 256)

# Display the video, see the tutorial for more details and options.
# Monochrome should automatically start and show the video in a loop.
mc.show_video(video, name="First Video", cmap='viridis', vmin=0, vmax=1)

# Play second video in sync with the first (note that the videos should have the same length)
video2 = (np.random.rand(500, 256, 256) * 65535).astype(dtype=np.uint16)
mc.show_video(video2, name="Second Video", comment="This is a uint16 video", bitrange="uint16")
# `bitrange` argument is optional, Monochrome will auto-detect the data type

# Layers can be added on top of video
overlay = np.random.rand(500, 256, 256)
overlay[:, 64:192, :] = np.nan # NaN values will be transparent pixels, see tutorial
mc.show_layer(overlay, parent="Second Video", cmap='PRGn', opacity='centered')

# List of functions:
# mc.show() is a shortcut for mc.show_video()/show_layer()/show_image()/show_file(),
#           it will try to auto-detect the input type and call the appropriate function.
# mc.show_video() to show videos
# mc.show_image() to show single images
# mc.show_layer() to show layers on top of videos/images
# mc.show_points() to visualize point positions over time over videos
# mc.show_flow() to visualize optical flow fields over time
# mc.show_file() to load videos from file in Monochrome
# mc.close_video() to close a video/layer/image
# mc.export_video() export a window (video+layers+...) as a MP4 video
# mc.launch() to start Monochrome from Python
# mc.quit() to close Monochrome
```

## Supported File Formats

Monochrome supports a wide range of file formats through both native handlers and a plugin system.

### Native File Handlers

* `.tif`, `.tiff` - TIFF image files (single or multi-page)
* Directory of TIFF files - Loads a directory containing TIFF images as a single video
* `.npy` - NumPy array with shape (time, height, width). The data type can be float (np.float32, np.float64), integer (uint8, uint16, etc.), or boolean.
* `.dat` - Raw binary file with shape (time, height, width) and data type float32 or MultiRecorder file format (used in the cardiac optical mapping community)

### Plugin-Based File Handlers

Monochrome uses a plugin system to support additional file formats:

* **Image Formats**: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.pgm` 
* **TIFF Variants**: `.tf8`, `.ptif`, `.ptiff`, `.lsm` (ZEISS LSM), `.btf`, `.bif` (Roche Digital Pathology), `.gel`, `.ndpi` (Hamamatsu Slide Scanner), `.stk`, `.qptiff` (Perkin Elmer Vectra)
* **Medical Imaging**: `.dcm`, `.dicom`, `.gdcm`, `.gipl`, `.hdf5`, `.hdr`, `.ipl`, `.img`, `.img.nz`, `.mgh`, `.mha`, `.mhd`, `.mnc`, `.mnc2`, `.nhdr`, `.nia`, `.nii`, `.nii.gz`, `.nrrd`, `.vtk`
* **Video Formats**: `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, `.gif`, `.wmv`, `.m4v`
* **MATLAB**: `.mat`
* **MiCAM Formats**: `.gsd`, `.gsh`, `.rsh`, `.rsm`, `.rsd` (MiCAM camera formats)

Drag & drop files into the window or associate the file extension with Monochrome to open them with a double-click. Required plugin dependencies will be downloaded automatically when opening files that need them.

## Usage & Key Bindings

Adjust settings for each video in the main control window. To view optical traces (average intensity in a region of interest over time), click in a video. Click and drag to move the region of interest. Right-click to remove the region of interest.
