## [Unreleased]

### v0.3.6 - 2025-09-10 |  <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">Consolidated Gradient, RNG fix, gamma-correct Text, docs/tests</span>

#### Added / Changed

- Gradient
    - Consolidated to a single public factory (`rich_gradient.gradient.Gradient`) that returns `BaseGradient` or `AnimatedGradient` internally.
    - Kept test helper methods by adding equivalents to `BaseGradient` (`_color_at`, `_styled`, `_interpolated_color`) and `_active_stops` initialization.
    - Added `background=` support to `BaseGradient`/`AnimatedGradient` for parity with previous API.
- Text
    - Interpolates colors with gamma-correct blending for visual consistency with `Gradient`.
- Spectrum
    - Uses a dedicated `random.Random(seed)` instance to avoid mutating global RNG state; behavior is deterministic per seed without side effects.
- Rule
    - Normalized invalid color errors to `ValueError` for consistency.
- Package Init
    - Centralized `rich-color-ext` install to package init; removed duplicate installs from other modules.
- Repo Hygiene
    - Removed committed build artifacts (`dist/`) and static site (`site/`) from source; they remain in `.gitignore`.
- Docs / Examples / Tests
    - README basic example fixed (missing parenthesis).
    - Benchmark test now measures actual console printing safely.
- CLI
    - Relaxed `--justify` and `--overflow` option annotations from `Literal[...]` to `str` with explicit validation for broader Typer/Click compatibility.
    - Pinned dependencies to stabilize CLI behavior: `typer>=0.12.5,<0.13` and `click>=8.1.7,<9.0.0`.
- Tests
    - Made CLI tests portable across Click/Typer versions by removing `mix_stderr` usage and accepting warnings from stdout or stderr.
- Cleanup
    - Removed duplicate internal `Gradient` factory leftover in `_animated_gradient.py`; the public factory now lives in `rich_gradient/gradient.py`.
- Docs
    - Added _base_gradient_ref.md for referencing BaseGradient
    - Added _animated_gradient_ref.md for referencing AnimatedGradient


#### Fixed

- Eliminated duplicate Gradient implementations that could drift out of sync.
- Avoided global RNG seeding in `Spectrum` that could affect host applications.


### v0.3.4 - 2025-09-03 | <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">Text.as_rich(), background gradients, spectrum + docs</span>

#### v0.3.4 Added

- Text
  - `.as_rich()` method to return a plain `rich.text.Text` with all spans/styles preserved.
  - `.rich` convenience property wrapping `as_rich()`.
  - Background gradients via `bgcolors=`; multiple bg stops interpolate alongside foreground.
  - Robust color normalization supporting `Color`, `ColorTriplet`, `(r,g,b)` tuples, CSS names, 3/6‑digit hex, and `rgb()` strings.
- Spectrum
  - Deterministic `seed`, color names, styles, hex accessors, and a rich preview table renderable.
- Docs/Examples
  - New SVG/PNG assets for gradient text examples under `docs/img/v0.3.4/` and updated spectrum preview.

#### v0.3.4 Updated

- Text
  - Improved error types/messages and comprehensive module documentation.
  - Single‑color fast‑path applies one composed `Style` across content for performance.
  - Empty text rendering no longer emits a trailing newline/segment; nested renderables filtered accordingly.
- Gradient and BaseGradient
  - Gamma‑corrected color interpolation, smoother stop wrapping, explicit alignment validation, and safer measurement when no renderables.
  - Support for `repeat_scale`/`phase` used by animated variants.
- Rule
  - Accepts colors as strings, `Color`, `ColorTriplet`, or RGB tuples with clearer validation and messages.
  - Title style applied after gradient generation for accurate highlighting.
- Package Init / Theme
  - Install `rich-color-ext` on import and monkey‑patch `Console._collect_renderables` to suppress empty `Text` trailing newline.
  - Theme helpers for consistent docs SVG generation (`GRADIENT_TERMINAL_THEME`).
- README/Docs
  - Expanded examples and color‑format visuals; refreshed links and images.

#### v0.3.4 Fixed

- Suppressed stray newline output when rendering empty gradient `Text` (affects console capture/recorded SVGs).

### v0.3.3 - 2025-08-27 | <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)"> Added tests and Fixed Bugs</span>

#### v0.3.3 Updated

- Enhanced rendering and color handling in gradient components
- Refactored rich-gradient for improved structure and functionality
  - Reorganized imports in `__init__.py` for clarity.
  - Updated AnimatedGradient to ensure color extension is installed at package import time.
  - Enhanced BaseGradient to improve gradient wrapping logic and error handling.
  - Improved logger utility with better error handling and configuration options.
  - Adjusted Gradient class to ensure quit panel behavior is consistent and intuitive.
  - Added comprehensive tests for edge cases in Gradient and Text classes, including long text, unicode handling, and color validation.
  - Enhanced Spectrum class to support color generation with optional seed for reproducibility.
  - Improved Text class to ensure proper initialization and color parsing.
  - Updated test suites for Gradient and Spectrum to cover additional scenarios and edge cases.

#### <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">v0.3.0 TODO</span>

- Work on Gradient Panel and Table Renderables

#### <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">v0.3.0 Removed</span>

Removed all of the the archived modules from rich_gradient/archive/*

### v0.2.1 <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">Rewrite</span>

There was a lot of overhead in rich-gradient so I rewrote it from the ground up with an actual goal. I created [rich-color-ext](https://github.com/maxludden/rich-color-ext) to wrap around rich's color parsing removing the need for the` _rgb.py`, `color.py`, `color_data.py`, `_colors.py`, and all of their tests.

### v0.2.0 - 2025-3-13 | <span style="color:rgb(215, 255, 100)">[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)</span>, pure python, and 3.13.2

There are a number of significant changes in v0.2.0:

#### <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">`rye` → `uv`</span>

Astral has done a hell of a job making python dev tools. [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) blew the existing python linters out of the water and uv pretty much did the same thing to package managers. Rich-gradient was started on [rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye) but as Astral has since depreciated it, it's moved to their current rust powered python package manager, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

#### <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">Pure Python</span>

Rich-gradient is now a pure-python package. This allows it to be more easily used regardless of platform. As rich-gradient previously had pydantic as a dependency, it now just borrows the logic from [`pydantic-extra-types.color`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-extra-types/blob/889319b7825331c18cedd16b80a09c2).

#### <span style="color: rgb(215, 255, 100)">3.13.2</span>

After switching to [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), the package has been updated to python 3.13.2.

### v0.2.0 Updated

- Switched rich-gradient package manager from [astral/rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye) to [astral/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Updated python to `3.13.2`

### v0.2.0 Changed

- Removed [`pydantic`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) and [`pydantic-extra-types`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-extra-types) dependencies.
- Updated the names of some of the colors. For example <span style="color: #7CFF00">greenyellow</span> became <span style="color: #7CFF00">lawngreen</span>.
- Updated `README.md`, `CHANGELOG`, and documentation.

### v0.2.0 Added

- `src/rich_gradient/_base_color.py`: stores the color logic from pydantic-extra-types.color modules stripped of the pydantic framwork.

## v0.1.7 - 2024-7-16 | Added support for Two-Color Gradients

### v0.1.7 Updated

- Updated Gradient.generate_subgradients() to default to returning a list containing a single simple gradient to allow
Gradients to work when only supplied with two colors.

![Two Color Gradient](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxludden/rich-gradient/3b6e2cb013eda3bcba9dbcdd14c65179d28532da/docs/img/simple_gradient_example.svg)

### v0.1.7 Added

- Added len, int, str, and repr dunder methods to `rich-gradient.gradient.Gradient` (will simply refer to as `Gradient` from here on out).
- Added a tests/test_gradient.py for Gradient to test two color gradiets
