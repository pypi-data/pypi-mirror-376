# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep this project and its users safe! üíô

## Supported Versions

We generally support security fixes on:
- the `main` branch (next release), and
- the latest published PyPI release.

Older versions may receive fixes at the maintainers‚Äô discretion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**  
Instead, use GitHub‚Äôs private security advisories:

‚û°Ô∏è **Report privately:** https://github.com/kstaniek/caneth/security/advisories/new

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the issue and **impact**.
- Steps to reproduce, a minimal PoC if possible.
- Affected version(s), Python version, and OS details.
- Any suggested mitigations or patches (optional but appreciated).

If you can‚Äôt use GitHub advisories for some reason, you may alternatively reach out via a direct GitHub message to @kstaniek.

## Disclosure Process

1. We will acknowledge your report within **3 business days**.
2. We will investigate and work on a fix; timelines depend on severity/complexity.
3. We will coordinate a **coordinated disclosure**, publishing a patched release and an advisory.
4. We‚Äôll credit reporters in release notes/advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Scope Notes

- Please test only against your own environments and data.
- Avoid actions that could degrade service for other users (no automated scanning against third-party systems).
- Denial-of-service and social engineering reports are out of scope unless a concrete, reproducible exploit affecting this project is demonstrated.

## Thanks

We appreciate responsible disclosure and the time you spend helping improve the project. üôè
