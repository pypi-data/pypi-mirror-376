# Python JIRA Plus
A lightweight Python wrapper around `pandas` that simplifies its syntax and makes common DataFrame operations easier to understand and use. <br>
This library is perfect for beginners, educators, or anyone who finds traditional pandas syntax too complex or verbose. Think of it as a "translation layer" ‚Äî turning hard-to-read code into intuitive and readable commands.
