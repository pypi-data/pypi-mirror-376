    """Base class for LangGraph-based agents with unified tool approach.

    Provides core LangGraph functionality including:
    - Graph compilation and execution
    - State schema management
    - I/O mapping between user inputs and graph states
    - Event emission support
    - Tool resolution and handling
    - A2A communication capabilities via tools
    - Agent delegation capabilities via tools
    - MCP server integration via tools
    - Enhanced output extraction from various state formats

    Tool Management:
    - regular_tools: Standard LangChain tools provided during initialization
    - mcp_tools: Tools retrieved from MCP servers
    - resolved_tools: Combined collection of all tools for graph execution

    Subclasses must implement:
    - define_graph(): Define the specific graph structure
    - _prepare_graph_input(): Convert user input to graph state
    - _format_graph_output(): Convert final graph state to user output
