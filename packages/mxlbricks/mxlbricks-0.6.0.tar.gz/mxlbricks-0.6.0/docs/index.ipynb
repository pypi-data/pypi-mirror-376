    "\n",
    "`mxlbricks` is a library built on top of [MxlPy](https://github.com/Computational-Biology-Aachen/MxlPy) to enable quick building of mechanistic learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is desirable to be able to build larger-scale metabolic models from smaller components, which can be tested and analysed in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the last decades we have not seen widespread use of such successful model composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to argue that this is due to the fact that most attempts to compose larger models use either entire existing models or metabolic pathways as the unit of composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the idealisation of a metabolic pathway as an isolated entity is not a realistic assumption, as it ignores the fact that the pathway is embedded in a larger network of reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially problematic regarding choices of energy and redox equivalents.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are frequently described as either parameters, conserved quantities or free variables in different models, depending on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to incompatibilities between the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus believe that the unit of composition should be the individual reactions and those reactions need to be described in a way that allows for the description of other model components to vary depending on the use case.\n",
