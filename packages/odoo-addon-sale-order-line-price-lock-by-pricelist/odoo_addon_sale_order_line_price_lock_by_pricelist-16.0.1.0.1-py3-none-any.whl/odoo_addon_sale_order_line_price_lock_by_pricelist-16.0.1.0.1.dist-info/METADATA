Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes we want to avoid that salesmen are able to modify prices that
are fixed and negociated with the customer in advance.

Configuration
=============

In order to configure the prices lock scope, go to the pricelist you
want to configure or create a new one from *Sales > Products >
Pricelists*.

Now, in the *Configuration* tab, you can set the scope on the field
\*\ *Lock product prices applied on*. The possible options are:

- All products: any rule will lock the price. Very restrictive.
- Product category: all the rules applied on product category, product
  or variants will lock the price.
- Product: all the rules applied on product or variants will lock the
  price.
- Product variant: only the rules applied on variants will lock the
  price.

For this example, we'll choose the *Product* scope.

Then, in the price rules, we'll add a fixed price of 80 to be applied on
the product *FURN_5555*. Save and close and go to the **Usage** section
to test it in the sales order.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to log in as a salesman (i.e.: demo user),
as sales manager won't be locked. Then:

1. Create a new sales order.
2. Chose the pricelist we configured before.
3. Add the product FURN_5555: you'll see that the price unit is locked.
4. Add another product: the price unit can be edited for that line.
5. Change the pricelist: now you can edit the price for FURN_5555 again.
