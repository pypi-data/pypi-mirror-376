In order to configure the prices lock scope, go to the pricelist you want to configure
or create a new one from *Sales > Products > Pricelists*.

Now, in the *Configuration* tab, you can set the scope on the field
**Lock product prices applied on*. The possible options are:

- All products: any rule will lock the price. Very restrictive.
- Product category: all the rules applied on product category, product or variants will
  lock the price.
- Product: all the rules applied on product or variants will lock the price.
- Product variant: only the rules applied on variants will lock the price.

For this example, we'll choose the *Product* scope.

Then, in the price rules, we'll add a fixed price of 80 to be applied on the product
*FURN_5555*. Save and close and go to the **Usage** section to test it in the sales order.
