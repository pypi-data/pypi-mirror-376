## Introduction
The Swimming Markup Language (swiML) formalises swim training programs. It uses XML technology to specify and transform data. The project is hosted at [https://github.com/bartneck/swiML](https://github.com/bartneck/swiML). Please report any problems and issues through GitHub. We welcome your contributions.

This Python library allows you to create valid swiML programs using the Python programming language. We are working on proper documentation. For now, please refer to GitHub for some examples of how to use it.
