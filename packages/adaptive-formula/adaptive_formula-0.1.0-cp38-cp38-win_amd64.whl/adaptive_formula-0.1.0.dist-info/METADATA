A "Cognitive Programming" framework for replacing complex `if/else` chains with declarative logic and adaptive scoring.



Code filled with nested conditionals is difficult to maintain, test, and scale. This SDK solves that problem by allowing you to define business logic as a **configurable mathematical formula** instead of rigid code. It transforms your rules into a weighted scoring system that is flexible, interpretable, and extremely fast.

---

## Key Features

* **üß† Declarative Logic:** Define your rules as a list of fields with weights and criticalities. Your code becomes more readable, and business logic is separated from the implementation.
* **‚öñÔ∏è Weighted Scoring:** Each field contributes to a final score based on its importance (weight) and its criticality, allowing for nuanced decisions instead of a simple pass/fail.
* **‚ú® ML-Powered Optimization (Premium):** The Professional and Enterprise tiers can auto-calibrate weights and criticalities based on historical data to optimize scoring accuracy.
* **üöÄ High Performance:** The core algorithm is written in **Cython**, compiled to C to deliver performance thousands of times faster than pure Python.
* **üß© Heterogeneous Data Handling (Premium):** Support for evaluating not just dictionaries, but also Pandas DataFrames, NumPy arrays, and other complex data types.

## Installation

Install the package directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install adaptive-formula
```

## Quick Start Guide

Here is a simple example for validating a new user's configuration.

```python
from adaptive_formula import CognitiveSDK, Field

# 1. Initialize the SDK (uses the 'Community' tier by default)
sdk = CognitiveSDK()

# 2. Configure the fields and their rules
# Define how important each field is for the validation.
sdk.configure([
    Field(name='has_verified_email', default=False, weight=3.0, criticality=5.0),
    Field(name='profile_completeness', default=0.0, weight=2.0, criticality=3.0),
    Field(name='country', default='unknown', weight=1.0, criticality=1.5),
])

# 3. Prepare the data to evaluate
new_user_data = {
    'has_verified_email': True,
    'profile_completeness': 0.85, # 85% complete
    'country': 'CO'
}

# 4. Evaluate and get the score
# The SDK compares the user data against the configured 'default' values.
score = sdk.evaluate(new_user_data)

print(f"User validation score: {score:.3f}")

if score > 0.75:
    print("‚úÖ User validated with high confidence.")
else:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è User requires additional review.")

```
