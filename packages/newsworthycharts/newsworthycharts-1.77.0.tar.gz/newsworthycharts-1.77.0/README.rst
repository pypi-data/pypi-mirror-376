This  module contains methods for producing graphs and publishing them on Amazon S3, or in the location of your choice.

It is written and maintained for `Newsworthy <https://www.newsworthy.se/en/>`_, but could possibly come in handy for other people as well.

By `Journalism++ Stockholm <http://jplusplus.org/sv>`_.

Installing
----------

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install newsworthycharts


Using
-----

This module comes with two classes, `Chart` and `Storage` (and it's subclasses).
When using the Chart class, the generated chart will be saved as a local file:

.. code-block:: python3

  from newsworthycharts import SerialChart as Chart


  c = Chart(600, 800)
  c.title = "Number of smiles per second"
  c.xlabel = "Time"
  c.ylabel = "Smiles"
  c.caption = "Source: Ministry of smiles."
  data_serie_1 = [("2008-01-01", 6.1), ("2009-01-01", 5.9), ("2010-01-01", 6.8)]
  c.data.append(data_serie_1)
  c.highlight = "2010-01-01"
  c.render("test", "png")

You can use one of the predefine chart classes to make common chart types. Or you can use Newsworthycharts together with Matplotlib. This is useful is you just want to add text elements such as subtitle, notes or apply a predefine theme.

Here is how you would make a pie chart:

.. code-block:: python3

  # data
  labels = 'Frogs', 'Hogs', 'Dogs', 'Logs'
  sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10]

  # setup chart
  chart = Chart(width=800, height=600, storage=local_storage)
  chart.title = "My pie chart"
  chart.subtitle = "Look at all those colors"

  # NB: Render the chart to `chart.ax`
  chart.ax.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%')

  # Save the chart
  chart.render("tailored_chart", "png")

You can use a _storage_ object to save file to
a specific location or cloud service:

.. code-block:: python3

  from newsworthycharts import Chart
  from newsworthycharts import S3Storage

  s3 = S3Storage("my_bucket")
  c = Chart(600, 800, storage=s3)
  c.title = "Number of smiles per second"
  c.subtitle = "This chart tells you something very important."
  c.xlabel = "Time"
  c.ylabel = "Smiles"
  c.note = "There are some missing smiles in data"
  c.caption = "Source: Ministry of smiles."
  c.render("test", "png")


To store a file in a local folder, use the `LocalStorage` class:

.. code-block:: python3

  from newsworthycharts import LocalStorage

  storage = LocalStorage("/path/to/generated/charts")

Charts are styled using built-in or user-defined styles:

.. code-block:: python3

  from newsworthycharts import Chart

  # This chart has the newsworthy default style
  c = Chart(600, 800, style="newsworthy")

  # Style can also be the path to a style file (absolute or relative to current working directory)
  c2 = Chart(600, 800, style="path/to/styles/mystyle.mplstyle")

To set up you own style, copy the build-in default: <https://github.com/jplusplus/newsworthycharts/blob/master/newsworthycharts/rc/newsworthy>

Newsworthycharts will look first among the predefined style files for the requested style, so if you have a custom style file in you working directory you need to give it a unique name not already in use.

  - Bar charts will now always have a small white edge
  - Don't break y axis if data is close to 0
