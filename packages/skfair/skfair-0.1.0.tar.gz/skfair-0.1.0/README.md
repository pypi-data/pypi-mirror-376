# skfair

`skfair` is a Python package that provides a wrapper for scikit-learn estimators to automatically capture FAIR compliant provenance metadata for ML workflows. It packages each training run as a standardised [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) research object, making experiments more transparent, reproducible, and interoperable.

<sub>ยน This package is based on a research project conducted at The University of Manchester, 2025.<br/>
