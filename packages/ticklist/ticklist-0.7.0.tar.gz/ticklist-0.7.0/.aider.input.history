+inside the demo.py file there is a Multiline() class inside the Annotated next to the str type annotation. This model is used to autogenerate a script by using the ticklist library which lives inside the src folder. Currently the Multiline does nothing. Make these changes for me: if the Multiline class is present next to the str annotation use a new fieldwidget which has multiline input. If not present, use the already available fieldwidget for single line input.

# 2025-05-30 13:47:32.698606
+consider the Multiline() class inside `Annotated` next to the str annotation for the name field. It does not do anything yet. But, using the library inside the src folder it should generate a multiline input widget. Implement this input widget. If Multiline is not present in the `Annotated`, use the already available input widget for single line inpt.

# 2025-05-30 13:50:11.366717
+the `multiline_type_iterator` will never get called as the chech is identical to `str_type_iterator`
