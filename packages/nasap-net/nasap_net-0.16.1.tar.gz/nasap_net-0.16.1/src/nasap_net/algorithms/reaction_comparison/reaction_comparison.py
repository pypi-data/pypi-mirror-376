    Check if two reactions are equivalent.

    Two reactions are equivalent if they meet the following conditions:
        1-1. They have the same number of reactants.
        1-2. They have the same number of products.
        2-1. They have the same initial assembly.
        2-2. They have the same entering assembly, or both are None.
        2-3. They have the same product assembly.
        2-4. They have the same leaving assembly, or both are None.
        3-1. If the reaction is intra-molecular, the trio of binding sites
            [metal, leaving, entering] must be equivalent.
        3-2. If the reaction is inter-molecular, the pair of binding sites
            [metal, leaving] of the initial assembly must be equivalent,
            and the entering binding site of the entering assembly must be
            equivalent to the entering binding site of the other reaction.
    
    Here, two binding site lists (e.g. [metal1, leaving1] and 
    [metal2, leaving2]) are equivalent if there is at least one isomorphism
    which maps each binding site in the first list to a binding site in 
    the second list. The order of the binding sites in the list DOES matter.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    reaction1 : IntraReaction | InterReaction
        The first reaction to compare.
    reaction2 : IntraReaction | InterReaction
        The second reaction to compare.
    id_to_assembly : Mapping[int, Assembly]
        A mapping from assembly IDs to assemblies. This must not include
        duplicate assemblies since this function only uses the IDs to
        compare the assemblies, not the assembly structures.
    component_structures : Mapping[str, Component]
        A mapping from component IDs to components.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the reactions are equivalent, False otherwise.
    
    Warnings
    --------
    This function treats assemblies with different IDs as distinct, 
    even if they are structurally identical. Please ensure that the 
    assemblies in `id_to_assembly` are not duplicates.
