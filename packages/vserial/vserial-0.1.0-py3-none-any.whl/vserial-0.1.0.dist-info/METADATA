A library for creating virtual serial devices with Python. Use cases include creating mocks and emulators.

Thank you to [Jaia Robotics](https://www.jaia.tech) for enabling the initial development of this library.

## Limitations

This library has only ever been tested on Linux. Windows compatibility has not yet been tested.

## Similar Projects

- [mock_serial](https://github.com/benthorner/mock_serial/tree/master) provides similar functionality for mocking serial devices, but is not as easily extended for creating simulations.
