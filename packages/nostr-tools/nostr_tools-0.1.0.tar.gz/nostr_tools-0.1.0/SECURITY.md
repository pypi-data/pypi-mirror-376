## üîí Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Security

nostr-tools implements industry-standard cryptographic practices:

#### **Elliptic Curve Cryptography**
- **Library**: `secp256k1` (Bitcoin's elliptic curve)
- **Key Generation**: Secure random number generation using `os.urandom()`
- **Signature Scheme**: Schnorr signatures as specified in NIP-01
- **Key Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all cryptographic inputs

#### **Random Number Generation**
```python
# Secure entropy source
import os
private_key_bytes = os.urandom(32)  # 256 bits of entropy
```

#### **Memory Safety**
- Automatic cleanup of sensitive data structures
- No persistence of private keys in memory longer than necessary
- Protection against memory dumps containing sensitive data

### Network Security

#### **Transport Layer Security**
- **Default Protocol**: WSS (WebSocket Secure) preferred over WS
- **TLS Validation**: Proper certificate validation for secure connections
- **Tor Support**: Native .onion relay support with SOCKS5 proxy

#### **Connection Security**
```python
# ‚úÖ Secure connection (recommended)
relay = Relay("wss://relay.example.com")

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Insecure connection (avoid in production)
relay = Relay("ws://relay.example.com")
```

### Input Validation Security

#### **Comprehensive Validation**
- All inputs validated for type, format, and range
- Protection against null-byte injection attacks
- Validation of event structure according to NIP-01
- Sanitization of untrusted data from network sources

#### **Example Validation**
```python
def validate_event_data(data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Comprehensive event validation with security checks."""
    # Type validation
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise TypeError("Event data must be a dictionary")

    # Required field validation
    required_fields = ["id", "pubkey", "created_at", "kind", "tags", "content", "sig"]
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise KeyError(f"Missing required field: {field}")

    # Format validation
    if not re.match(r"^[0-9a-f]{64}$", data["id"]):
        raise ValueError("Invalid event ID format")

    # Content sanitization
    if "\x00" in data["content"]:
        raise ValueError("Null bytes not allowed in content")
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Library Users

#### **Private Key Management**
```python
import os
from nostr_tools import generate_keypair

# ‚úÖ DO: Use environment variables for key storage
private_key = os.getenv('NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY')
if not private_key:
    private_key, public_key = generate_keypair()
    # Store securely (use proper key management in production)

# ‚úÖ DO: Use secure key generation
private_key, public_key = generate_keypair()  # Uses os.urandom()

# ‚ùå DON'T: Hardcode private keys
# private_key = "..."  # Never do this!

# ‚ùå DON'T: Store keys in plaintext files
# with open('private_key.txt', 'w') as f:
#     f.write(private_key)  # Insecure!
```

#### **Network Security**
```python
from nostr_tools import Relay, Client

# ‚úÖ DO: Use secure WebSocket connections
relay = Relay("wss://relay.example.com")  # Encrypted connection

# ‚úÖ DO: Validate relay certificates (automatic)
client = Client(relay, timeout=30)

# ‚úÖ DO: Use Tor for enhanced privacy when needed
tor_relay = Relay("wss://example.onion")
tor_client = Client(
    tor_relay,
    socks5_proxy_url="socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"
)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è AVOID: Unencrypted connections in production
# relay = Relay("ws://relay.example.com")  # Unencrypted!
```

#### **Input Validation**
```python
from nostr_tools import Event, sanitize

# ‚úÖ DO: Validate all external data
def safe_event_handler(event_data):
    try:
        # Automatic validation during Event creation
        event = Event.from_dict(event_data)

        # Additional sanitization for display
        safe_content = sanitize(event.content)
        return safe_content
    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        print(f"Invalid event rejected: {e}")
        return None

# ‚úÖ DO: Sanitize data from untrusted sources
untrusted_data = {"content": "Hello\x00World"}
clean_data = sanitize(untrusted_data)  # Removes null bytes
```

#### **Error Handling**
```python
from nostr_tools import RelayConnectionError
import logging

# ‚úÖ DO: Handle errors gracefully without information leakage
async def secure_relay_connection():
    try:
        async with client:
            # Relay operations
            pass
    except RelayConnectionError as e:
        # Log error securely (don't expose sensitive info)
        logging.warning("Relay connection failed")
        # Don't log the full exception in production
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch unexpected errors
        logging.error("Unexpected error occurred")
        # Don't expose internal details to users

# ‚ùå DON'T: Expose sensitive information in error messages
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"Error: {e}")  # May contain sensitive details
```

### For Library Contributors

#### **Secure Development Practices**
```python
# ‚úÖ DO: Validate all inputs comprehensively
def process_relay_metadata(data: Any) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Type validation
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        return None

    # Sanitize all string values
    sanitized = {}
    for key, value in data.items():
        if isinstance(key, str) and isinstance(value, (str, int, list, dict)):
            sanitized[sanitize(key)] = sanitize(value)

    return sanitized

# ‚úÖ DO: Use type hints for security clarity
def sign_event(private_key: str, event_id: str) -> str:
    """Sign event with proper type validation."""
    if not isinstance(private_key, str) or len(private_key) != 64:
        raise ValueError("Invalid private key format")
    # Implementation...

# ‚úÖ DO: Implement comprehensive error handling
def validate_signature(event_id: str, pubkey: str, signature: str) -> bool:
    """Validate signature with proper error handling."""
    try:
        # Validation logic
        return True
    except Exception:
        # Never expose internal cryptographic errors
        return False
```

#### **Testing Security**
```python
# Security-focused test example
@pytest.mark.security
def test_private_key_not_exposed_in_error():
    """Ensure private keys are not exposed in error messages."""
    private_key = "..."

    try:
        # Trigger an error condition
        result = some_operation(private_key)
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = str(e)

        # Verify sensitive data is not in error message
        assert private_key not in error_message
        assert "sensitive" not in error_message.lower()
```

## üìö Security Education

### Common Security Pitfalls

#### **Cryptographic Mistakes**
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T: Use weak random number generation
import random
weak_key = random.randint(1, 2**256)  # Predictable!

# ‚úÖ DO: Use cryptographically secure random generation
import os
secure_key = os.urandom(32)  # Cryptographically secure
```

#### **Key Management Errors**
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T: Log private keys
logging.info(f"Generated key: {private_key}")  # Sensitive data!

# ‚úÖ DO: Log only non-sensitive information
logging.info("Keypair generated successfully")
```

#### **Input Validation Bypass**
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T: Trust external data
def process_event(data):
    event_id = data["id"]  # What if data is not a dict?
    # Process without validation...

# ‚úÖ DO: Validate everything
def process_event(data):
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise TypeError("Expected dictionary")

    event = Event.from_dict(data)  # Comprehensive validation
    # Safe to process validated event
```
