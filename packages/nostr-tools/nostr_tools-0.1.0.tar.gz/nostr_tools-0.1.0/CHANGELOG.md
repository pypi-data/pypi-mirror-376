pip install nostr-tools

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/bigbrotr/nostr-tools.git
cd nostr-tools
pip install -e .[dev]
```

#### **Basic Usage**
```python
import asyncio
from nostr_tools import Client, Relay, generate_keypair, generate_event, Event

async def main():
    # Generate keypair
    private_key, public_key = generate_keypair()

    # Connect to relay
    relay = Relay("wss://relay.damus.io")
    client = Client(relay)

    async with client:
        # Create and publish event
        event_data = generate_event(
            private_key, public_key, 1, [], "Hello Nostr!"
        )
        event = Event.from_dict(event_data)
        success = await client.publish(event)
        print(f"Published: {success}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 🔮 Known Limitations
