        :param scope: The scope in which to define this construct.
        :param id_: The scoped construct ID. Must be unique amongst siblings in the same scope
        :param name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with `RFC1035 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt>`_. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression '`a-z <%5B-a-z0-9%5D*%5Ba-z0-9%5D>`_?' which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.

        :param target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. - For load balancers, see the "Target" column in `Port specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_. - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle: - 'vpc-sc' - ` APIs that support VPC Service Controls <https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products>`_. - 'all-apis' - `All supported Google APIs <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect#supported-apis>`_. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment.

        :param external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_state: Specifies the canary migration state for the backend buckets attached to this forwarding rule. Possible values are PREPARE, TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE, and TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC. To begin the migration from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED, the state must be changed to PREPARE. The state must be changed to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC before the loadBalancingScheme can be changed to EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate traffic to backend buckets attached to this forwarding rule by percentage using externalManagedBackendBucketMigrationTestingPercentage. Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL. Possible values: ["PREPARE", "TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE", "TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_state ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_state}
        :param external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_testing_percentage: Determines the fraction of requests to backend buckets that should be processed by the Global external Application Load Balancer. The value of this field must be in the range [0, 100]. This value can only be set if the loadBalancingScheme in the forwarding rule is set to EXTERNAL (when using the Classic ALB) and the migration state is TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_testing_percentage ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_testing_percentage}
        :param id: Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#id ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#id}. Please be aware that the id field is automatically added to all resources in Terraform providers using a Terraform provider SDK version below 2. If you experience problems setting this value it might not be settable. Please take a look at the provider documentation to ensure it should be settable.
        :param ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced 'target'. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an 'IPAddress' is required under the following circumstances: - When the 'target' is set to 'targetGrpcProxy' and 'validateForProxyless' is set to 'true', the 'IPAddress' should be set to '0.0.0.0'. - When the 'target' is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an 'IPAddress'. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: - IP address number, as in '100.1.2.3' - IPv6 address range, as in '2600:1234::/96' - Full resource URL, as in 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - Partial URL or by name, as in: - 'projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'global/addresses/address-name' - 'address-name' The forwarding rule's 'target', and in most cases, also the 'loadBalancingScheme', determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see `IP address specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_. When reading an 'IPAddress', the API always returns the IP address number. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#ip_address ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#ip_address}
        :param ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid options are 'TCP', 'UDP', 'ESP', 'AH', 'SCTP', 'ICMP' and 'L3_DEFAULT'. The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products as described in `Load balancing features <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends>`_. Possible values: ["TCP", "UDP", "ESP", "AH", "SCTP", "ICMP"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#ip_protocol ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#ip_protocol}
        :param ip_version: The IP Version that will be used by this global forwarding rule. Possible values: ["IPV4", "IPV6"]. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#ip_version ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#ip_version}
        :param labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule. A list of key->value pairs. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#labels ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#labels}
        :param load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type. For more information about forwarding rules, refer to `Forwarding rule concepts <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts>`_. Default value: "EXTERNAL" Possible values: ["EXTERNAL", "EXTERNAL_MANAGED", "INTERNAL_MANAGED", "INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#load_balancing_scheme ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#load_balancing_scheme}
        :param metadata_filters: metadata_filters block. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#metadata_filters ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#metadata_filters}
        :param network: This field is not used for external load balancing. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used. If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will be used. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must be provided. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#network ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#network}
        :param network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load balancer and can only take the following values: 'PREMIUM', 'STANDARD'. For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are 'PREMIUM' and 'STANDARD'. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is 'PREMIUM'. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be 'PREMIUM'. If 'IPAddress' is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address. Possible values: ["PREMIUM", "STANDARD"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#network_tier ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#network_tier}
        :param no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#no_automate_dns_zone ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#no_automate_dns_zone}
        :param port_range: The 'portRange' field has the following limitations: * It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN. - Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See `port specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications>`_ for details. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's.
        :param project: Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#project ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#project}.
        :param service_directory_registrations: service_directory_registrations block. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#service_directory_registrations ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#service_directory_registrations}
        :param source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24). Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#source_ip_ranges ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#source_ip_ranges}
        :param subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and network load balancing with IPv6. If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.

For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. - For load balancers, see the "Target" column in `Port specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_. - For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle: - 'vpc-sc' - ` APIs that support VPC Service Controls <https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products>`_. - 'all-apis' - `All supported Google APIs <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect#supported-apis>`_.

        :param external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_state: Specifies the canary migration state for the backend buckets attached to this forwarding rule. Possible values are PREPARE, TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE, and TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC. To begin the migration from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED, the state must be changed to PREPARE. The state must be changed to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC before the loadBalancingScheme can be changed to EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate traffic to backend buckets attached to this forwarding rule by percentage using externalManagedBackendBucketMigrationTestingPercentage. Rolling back a migration requires the states to be set in reverse order. So changing the scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at the same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate some traffic back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL. Possible values: ["PREPARE", "TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE", "TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_state ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_state}
        :param external_managed_backend_bucket_migration_testing_percentage: Determines the fraction of requests to backend buckets that should be processed by the Global external Application Load Balancer. The value of this field must be in the range [0, 100]. This value can only be set if the loadBalancingScheme in the forwarding rule is set to EXTERNAL (when using the Classic ALB) and the migration state is TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE.

        :param id: Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#id ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#id}. Please be aware that the id field is automatically added to all resources in Terraform providers using a Terraform provider SDK version below 2. If you experience problems setting this value it might not be settable. Please take a look at the provider documentation to ensure it should be settable.
        :param ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced 'target'. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an 'IPAddress' is required under the following circumstances: - When the 'target' is set to 'targetGrpcProxy' and 'validateForProxyless' is set to 'true', the 'IPAddress' should be set to '0.0.0.0'. - When the 'target' is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an 'IPAddress'. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: - IP address number, as in '100.1.2.3' - IPv6 address range, as in '2600:1234::/96' - Full resource URL, as in 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - Partial URL or by name, as in: - 'projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'global/addresses/address-name' - 'address-name' The forwarding rule's 'target', and in most cases, also the 'loadBalancingScheme', determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see `IP address specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_. When reading an 'IPAddress', the API always returns the IP address number.

        :param ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid options are 'TCP', 'UDP', 'ESP', 'AH', 'SCTP', 'ICMP' and 'L3_DEFAULT'. The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products as described in `Load balancing features <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends>`_. Possible values: ["TCP", "UDP", "ESP", "AH", "SCTP", "ICMP"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#ip_protocol ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#ip_protocol}

        :param labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule. A list of key->value pairs. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource.

        :param load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type. For more information about forwarding rules, refer to `Forwarding rule concepts <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts>`_. Default value: "EXTERNAL" Possible values: ["EXTERNAL", "EXTERNAL_MANAGED", "INTERNAL_MANAGED", "INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#load_balancing_scheme ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#load_balancing_scheme}

        :param network: This field is not used for external load balancing. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used. If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will be used. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must be provided.

        :param network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load balancer and can only take the following values: 'PREMIUM', 'STANDARD'. For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are 'PREMIUM' and 'STANDARD'. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is 'PREMIUM'. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be 'PREMIUM'. If 'IPAddress' is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address. Possible values: ["PREMIUM", "STANDARD"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#network_tier ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#network_tier}
        :param no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/6.49.3/docs/resources/compute_global_forwarding_rule#no_automate_dns_zone ComputeGlobalForwardingRule#no_automate_dns_zone}
        :param port_range: The 'portRange' field has the following limitations: * It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN. - Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See `port specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications>`_ for details. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's.

        :param source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).

        :param subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and network load balancing with IPv6. If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.

        When a client
        sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
        to the referenced 'target'.

        While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an 'IPAddress' is
        required under the following circumstances:

        - When the 'target' is set to 'targetGrpcProxy' and
          'validateForProxyless' is set to 'true', the
          'IPAddress' should be set to '0.0.0.0'.
        - When the 'target' is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
          bundle, you must specify an 'IPAddress'.

        Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
        existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
        assigns an ephemeral IP address.

        Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
        forwarding rule:

        - IP address number, as in '100.1.2.3'
        - IPv6 address range, as in '2600:1234::/96'
        - Full resource URL, as in
          'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name'
        - Partial URL or by name, as in:

          - 'projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name'
          - 'regions/region/addresses/address-name'
          - 'global/addresses/address-name'
          - 'address-name'

        The forwarding rule's 'target',
        and in most cases, also the 'loadBalancingScheme', determine the
        type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
        `IP address
        specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_.

        When reading an 'IPAddress', the API always returns the IP
        address number.
