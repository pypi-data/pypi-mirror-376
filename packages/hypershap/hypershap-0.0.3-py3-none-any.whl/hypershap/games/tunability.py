"""Hyperparameter tunability games for analyzing the impact of tuning hyperparameters on performance.

This module provides a suite of game-theoretic tools for analyzing the tunability
of hyperparameters within a surrogate model of a black-box optimization
process.  It defines classes that implement search-based games, allowing
exploration of scenarios involving coalitions of hyperparameters and assessment
of their impact on optimization performance.  The module leverages the
`ExplanationTask` from `hypershap.task` to represent the hyperparameter
search space and surrogate model, and provides flexible configuration options
through the `ConfigSpaceSearcher` interface.

The core functionality revolves around defining games like `TunabilityGame`,
`SensitivityGame`, and `MistunabilityGame`, each representing a different
aspect of hyperparameter behavior under coalition-based constraints. These
games are built upon search strategies and allow for in-depth understanding of
hyperparameter dependencies and potential for optimization gains.
