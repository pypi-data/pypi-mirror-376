"""HyperSHAP: Shapley values and interactions for explaining hyperparameter optimization.

HyperSHAP is a package for explaining hyperparameter optimization, i.e., the effect of specific hyperparameter values,
the tunability of machine learning algorithms, or biases in the optimizer. The package is based on the well established
Shapley value and its generalization to interactions.
