I don't think it's there, unless this is combined with "Messages"?

## Gemini [created:: 2025-06-08T12:37:50+00:00]

That's a very logical question to ask when an option is missing. It's common for
Google to bundle related services in Takeout.

However, in this case, your Gemini chat history is **not** combined with
"Messages". The "Messages" service in Google Takeout is for exporting SMS and
RCS text messages from your Android phone if you use the Google Messages app.

Your Gemini conversations are considered part of your general account activity,
which can be a bit confusing. You've hit upon the single most common point of
failure when trying to export this data.

The option you are looking for is not a top-level product called "Gemini". It is
nested *inside* "My Activity".

Let's try a more precise, targeted approach.

### The Definitive Step-by-Step Guide

1. Go to [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com) and click **"Deselect
   all"**.
2. Scroll down to the product named **"My Activity"** and check the box next to
   it.
3. A button will appear that says "**All activity data included**". **Click this
   button.** A pop-up window will appear.
4. In the pop-up window, click **"Deselect all"** again.
5. Now, scroll through this new, smaller list and find **"Gemini Apps"**. Check
   the box next to it.
6. Click **"OK"** to close the pop-up. The button should now say something like
   "1 format selected".
7. Scroll to the bottom of the main page and click **"Next step"** to create and
   download your export.

### Why It's Structured This Way

Google considers your interactions with the Gemini web app (your prompts and the
responses) to be a specific *type of activity* on your account, just like a
search query or a YouTube video you watched. It doesn't treat Gemini as a
product with standalone data (like Gmail or Google Photos), but rather as a
feature whose history is logged in your central "My Activity" record.

This is unintuitive, but it is the correct and official method. I am confident
that if your activity saving is enabled and you follow these specific steps to
look *inside* "My Activity," you will find the "Gemini Apps" data to export.
