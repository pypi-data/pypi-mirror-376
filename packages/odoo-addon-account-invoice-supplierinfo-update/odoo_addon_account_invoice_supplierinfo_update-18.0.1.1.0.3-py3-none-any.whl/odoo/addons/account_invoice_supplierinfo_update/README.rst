This module allows to automatically update all products information in a
vendor bill for which the purchase information on the line is different
from the vendor information defined in the product form.

It creates a new vendor information line if there isn't any, or it
updates the first one in the list.

Usage
=====

This module adds a new button 'Check Supplier Info' in supplier invoice
form.

|image|

When the user clicks on it, they can see the changes that will apply to
the vendor information. Optionally, they can remove some temporary
changes, specially, if, for example, a vendor applied an exceptional
price change.

|image1|

- blue: Creates a full new supplier info line
- brown: Updates current settings, displaying price variation (%)

This module adds an extra boolean field 'Supplier Informations Checked'
in the 'Other Info' tab inside the supplier invoice form. This field
indicates that the prices have been checked and supplierinfo updated (or
eventually that the changes have been ignored).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- This module does not manage correctly the difference if invoice line
  taxes are not the same as products taxes. (If one is marked as tax
  included in the price and the other is marked as tax excluded in the
  price.)
- Refactor this module to share algorithm with the similar module
  purchase_order_supplierinfo_update
