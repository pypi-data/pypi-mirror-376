## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend. 

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Geoscience object schemas

Seequent geoscience object schemas define metadata and data serialisation of various geoscience objects. The goals include:
* Facilitate interoperability between various applications and services that produce and consume geoscience data.
* A data interchange specification to facilitate interoperabilities between various industry/segment standards.

For more details on geoscience object schemas, see the geoscience object schema [documentation.](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/data-structures/geoscience-objects/)

## Pre-requisites
- Python >= 3.10

## Installation
