# lefschetz-family


## Description
This Sage package provides a means of efficiently computing periods of complex projective hypersurfaces and elliptic surfaces over $\mathbb P^1$ with certified rigorous precision bounds.
It implements the methods described in 
- [Effective homology and periods of complex projective hypersurfaces](https://doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3947) ([arxiv:2306.05263](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.05263)).
- [A semi-numerical algorithm for the homology lattice and periods of complex elliptic surfaces over the projective line](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2024.102357) ([arxiv:2401.05131](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05131)).
- [Periods of fibre products of elliptic surfaces and the Gamma conjecture](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.07685) ([arxiv:2505.07685](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.07685)).
- [Periods in algebraic geometry : computations and application to Feynman integrals](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04823423) ([hal:tel-04823423](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04823423)).
- [Galois groups of symmetric cubic surfaces](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.06785) ([arxiv:2509.06785](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.06785)).

This package is a successor to the [numperiods](https://gitlab.inria.fr/lairez/numperiods) package by Pierre Lairez. It contains files taken from this package, that have sometimes been slightly modified to accomodate for new usage.

## How to install

In a terminal, run
```
sage -pip install git+https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra.git
sage -pip install lefschetz-family
```
or
```
sage -pip install --user git+https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra.git
sage -pip install --user lefschetz-family
```

Alternatively, install the `ore_alegbra` package (available at [https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra](https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra)), then download this repository and add the path to the main folder to your `sys.path`.

## Requirements
Sage 9.0 and above is recommended. Furthermore, this package has the following dependencies:

- [Ore Algebra](https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra).
- The [delaunay-triangulation](https://pypi.org/project/delaunay-triangulation/) package from PyPI.

## Roadmap
Near future milestones:
- [x] Encapsulate integration step in its own class
- [x] Certified computation of the exceptional divisors
- [x] Saving time on differential operator by precomputing cache before parallelization
- [x] Computing periods of elliptic fibrations.
- [x] Removing dependency on `numperiods`.

Middle term goals include:
- [ ] Making Delaunay triangulation functional again
- [ ] Having own implementation of 2D voronoi graphs/Delaunay triangulation

Long term goals include:
- [x] Tackling cubic threefolds.
- [x] Generic code for all dimensions.
- [x] Computing periods of K3 surfaces with mildy singular quartic models.
- [ ] Dealing with other singularities, especially curves.
- [ ] Computing periods of complete intersections.
- [x] Computing periods of weighted projective hypersurfaces, notably double covers of $\mathbb P^2$ ramified along a sextic.

Other directions include:
- [ ] Computation of homology through braid groups instead of monodromy of differential operators.
