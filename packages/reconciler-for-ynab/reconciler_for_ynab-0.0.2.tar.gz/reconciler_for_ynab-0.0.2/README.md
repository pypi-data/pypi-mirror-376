Reconcile for YNAB - Reconcile YNAB transactions from the CLI

## What This Does

When YNAB imports your transactions and balances in sync, reconciliation is simple. But if thereâ€™s a mismatch, it often means tedious work. I was frustrated with going line-by-line through records to find the difference so I wrote this tool. It streamlines the process: pick an account and target balance to get a list of transactions that must be reconciled to hit the balance, or let it reconcile automatically through the [YNAB API](https://api.ynab.com/).

## Installation

```console
$ pip install reconciler-for-ynab
```

## Usage

### Token

Provision a [YNAB Personal Access Token](https://api.ynab.com/#personal-access-tokens) and save it as an environment variable.

```console
$ export YNAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
```

### Quickstart

Run the tool from the terminal to print out the transactions:

```console
$ reconciler-for-ynab --account-name-regex 1234 --target 500.30
```

Run it again with `--reconcile` to reconcile the account.

```console
$ reconciler-for-ynab --account-name-regex 1234 --target 500.30 --reconcile
```

### All Options

```console
$ reconcile-for-ynab --help
usage: reconciler-for-ynab [-h] --account-name-regex ACCOUNT_NAME_REGEX --target TARGET [--reconcile] [--sqlite-export-for-ynab-db SQLITE_EXPORT_FOR_YNAB_DB]
                           [--sqlite-export-for-ynab-full-refresh] [--version]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --account-name-regex ACCOUNT_NAME_REGEX
                        Regex to match account name (must match exactly one account)
  --target TARGET       Target balance to match towards for reconciliation
  --reconcile           Whether to actually perform the reconciliation - if not set, just shows the transcations that would be reconciled
  --sqlite-export-for-ynab-db SQLITE_EXPORT_FOR_YNAB_DB
                        Path to sqlite-export-for-ynab SQLite DB file (respects sqlite-export-for-ynab configuration)
  --sqlite-export-for-ynab-full-refresh
                        Whether to do a full refresh of the YNAB data - if not set, only does an incremental refresh
  --version             show program's version number and exit
```
