  title: Chains to be scored.
  short: List of chains to be scored. If empty/unspecified, all inter-chains
   contacts will be considered for the final prediction.
  long: List of chains to be scored. If empty/unspecified, all inter-chains
   contacts will be considered for the final prediction. In specific cases,
   for example antibody-antigen complexes, some chains should be considered
   as a single molecule. Use the chains parameter to provide a list of chains
   that should be considered for the calculation. Use commas to include
   multiple chains as part of a single group.
   ["A", "B"]      => Contacts calculated (only) between chains A and B.
   ["A,B", "C"]    => Contacts calculated (only) between chains A and C; and B and C.
   ["A", "B", "C"] => Contacts calculated (only) between chains A and B; B and C; and A and C.
