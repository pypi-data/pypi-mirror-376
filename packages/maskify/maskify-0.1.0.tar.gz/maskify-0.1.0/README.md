
# Maskify

`maskify` is a Python module designed to efficiently mask sensitive columns in large CSV / DAT files using character-level substitution. It leverages **Polars** for high-performance data manipulation and provides a memory-efficient way to process large files in chunks.

## üöÄ Features

- Process large CSV / DAT files in chunks without consuming excessive memory.
- Mask specified columns by substituting lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits with customizable cipher mappings.
- Skip masking for NULL, "NA" (case-insensitive), or empty values.
- Simple API for flexible integration into data pipelines.

## ‚úÖ Installation

Install `maskify` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install maskify
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Cipher Maps

Use `create_cipher_maps_letters_digits()` to generate random mappings for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and digits.

```python
from maskify import create_cipher_maps_letters_digits

cipher_maps = create_cipher_maps_letters_digits()
letters_lower_map, letters_upper_map, digits_map = cipher_maps
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Process and Mask Data

Use `process_maskify()` to mask specified columns in a CSV / DAT file and save the masked output.

```python
from maskify import process_maskify

output_file = process_maskify(
    input_file='data/input.csv',
    separator=',',
    columns_to_mask=['name', 'id'],
    enCipher=(letters_lower_map, letters_upper_map, digits_map),
    output_file='data/output_masked.csv'
)

print(f"Masked file saved at: {output_file}")
```
