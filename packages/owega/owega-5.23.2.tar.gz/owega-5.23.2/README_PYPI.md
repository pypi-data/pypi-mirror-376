## ΦωΦ's homepage
You can check on the source code [on its gitlab page](https://git.pyrokinesis.fr/darkgeem/owega)!

Also, here's the [discord support server](https://discord.gg/KdRmyRrA48), you
can even get pinged on updates, if you want!


## Features
ΦωΦ has quite a lot of features!

These include:
- Saving/loading conversation to disk as json files.
- Autocompletion for commands, file search, etc...
- History management.
- Temp files to save every message, so that you can get back the conversation
  if you ever have to force-quit ΦωΦ.
- Config file to keep settings like api key, preferred model, command execution
  status...
- Command execution: if enabled, allows ΦωΦ to execute commands on your system
  and interpret the results.
- File creation: if commands are enabled, also allows ΦωΦ to create files on
  your system and fill them with desired contents.
- GET requests: allows ΦωΦ to get informations from online pages, through
  http(s) GET requests.
- Long-term memory: allows for ΦωΦ to store memories, which will not be deleted
  as the older messages are, to keep requests under the available tokens per
  request.
- Context management: allows to set the AI context prompt (example: "you are a
  cat. cats don't talk. you can only communicate by meowing, purring, and
  actions between asterisks" will transform ΦωΦ into a cat!!)
- Meow.
- Meow meow.
- MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW!!!!

3.2.0: FUNCTION CALLING UPDATE:
       added function calling, now openchat is able to run commands
       on your computer, as long as you allow it to
       (you will be prompted on each time it tries to run a command)
       !!! only available on -0613 models (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, gpt-4-0613) !!!
       will be available on all gpt models from 2023-06-27, with the latest
       openchat 3.2.X patch
3.2.1: fixed a space missing in openchat's function calling
3.2.2: fixed openchat sometimes not detecting the command has been ran

3.2.10: added a command line option for specifying the config file
3.2.11: now, the default gpt models implement function calling, no need for
        0613 anymore

3.3.0: implemented prompt_toolkit, for better prompt handling, newlines with
       control+n
3.3.1: added tokens command, to change the amount of requested tokens

3.4.0: CLI update:
         - added command-line options to change input/output files
         - added command-line option to ask a question from command line

3.5.0: WEB update: now added a flask app, switched repos to its own
3.5.1: added "commands" command, to enable/disable command execution
3.5.2: added infos on bottom bar

3.6.0: PREFIX update:
         - added prefixes for command (changeable in the config)
         - reformatted most of the main loop code to split it in handlers

3.7.0: DIRECT CONTEXT COMMANDS update:
         - now, you can use commands in one line, instead of waitingfor prompt
             example: /save hello.json
             (instead of typing /save, then enter, then typing hello.json
              works on all commands, the only specific case being file_input.)
         - file_input as a direct command takes only one argument: the file
             to load (e.g. /load ./src/main.c). The pre-prompt will be asked
             directly instead of having to do it in three steps
               (/load, then filename, then pre-prompt)
         - also, fixed /tokens splitting the prompt instead of the user input

3.8.0: WEB download update

             for curl

5.18.0: Fixed function calling for mistral.
5.18.1: Added fancy err message for flagged messages (OpenAI).

        the raw text without disabling fancy mode)
        (Also, updated build system to use pyproject.toml)
5.19.1: Fixed issues with custom models.

          from assistant.
5.20.1: Changed the append_blank_user to "" instead of ".".
5.20.2: Moved the preferred config location to
          $HOME/.config/owega/config.json5

5.21.0: Changed the config loading logic to load all
          .json/.json5 files in ~/.config/owega/ or given dirs
          to allow saving API keys in a dedicated config file.
        Moved the defaults to owega/constants.py to replace
          hardcoded values.
5.21.1: Added a /send alias to dir_input, fixed relative files
          being refused because 'parent dir does not exist',
          allows /dir_input to take files, with an automatic
          pre-prompt ('dir/filename.ext:' before file contents)
5.21.2: Moved clr and clrtxt to owega/colors.py
5.21.3: Refactored bool/float input handlers to use centralized
          helper setter functions.
          (owega/OweHandlers/helpers.py)
5.21.4: Removed redundant info_print and debug_print in utils.py
          This does not affect anything, as utils.py
          still imports them from owega.config
        Changed /genconf and genconfig() behavior to generate
          ~/.config/owega/, and split api key/non api key values
          to the api.json5 and config.json5 files respectively.

5.22.0: = The model update =
        - Added openrouter integration!!!
        - Added new model naming schemes:
            [provider]:[model]
            custom:[model]@[base_url]
          Provider list:
          - anthropic (anthropic.com - claude-3.7-sonnet...)
          - chub (chub.ai)
          - mistral (mistral.ai - mistral/mixtral/codestral...)
          - openai (openai.com - GPT-4o/GPT-4.1/o1...)
          - openrouter (openrouter.ai - recommended)
          - xai (x.ai - grok)
          - custom
        - Cleaned up some code in ask.py
        - Added some error handling so errors won't throw you
          out of owega anymore.
        - Handles ctrl+c to cancel a pending request.
          (so it doesn't throw you out of owega anymore either.)
5.22.1: Changed the default model list and added openrouter_api
          as a default blank parameter.
5.22.2: Fixed the config file loading order, config files will
          now load in alphabetical order (python string sort)
5.22.3: Added function calling for openrouter!
5.22.4: Fixed a bug where some unicode characters would not load
          properly, and prevent the user from using owega if
          their Conversation contained invalid ones.
        Also fixed a bug where get_page would try and run
          debug_print with an old syntax.
        Note to self: Please, replace all debug_print uses with
                      getLogger loggers.

5.23.0: Added /web command to enable/disable
          the web access feature.
5.23.1: Added /lts command to enable/disable long term souvenirs
          and permanently disabled the image generation 'tool'
