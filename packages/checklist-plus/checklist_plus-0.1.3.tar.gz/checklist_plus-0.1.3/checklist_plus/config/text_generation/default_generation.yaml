  unmask_prompt:
    task_context: "You are a text completion expert. Complete the given text by filling in ALL {mask_count} blank(s) (___)."
    background_data:
      context: "Focus on generating completions related to following context: {context}"
      candidates: "Consider the following candidate words: {candidates}. Pick from these if they fit well and sort them by relevance (descending)."
    rules: |
      Generate exactly {n_completions} unique, diverse sets of completions that fit the context well and relate to the specified topic. Each completion should be either:
      1) A single word (e.g., "performance", "strategy", "goal")
      2) A possessive noun phrase (e.g., "goalkeeper's performance", "team's strategy", "player's goal")
      3) If you are given a list of candidates, you must select from them and sort by relevance (descending).

      Avoid longer phrases like "museum that I visited" or "beautiful sunset today".
    task: "Text to complete: {text}"
    thinking_step: "Consider the context before you respond. If candidates are provided, consider them one by one and select the most relevant."
    output_format: |
      Provide each set as a list with {mask_count} item(s) in order. Examples:
      - For 1 mask: [["performance"], ["strategy"], ["goal"]]
      - For 2 masks: [["game", "it"], ["performance", "food"], ["movie", "service"]]

    background_data: "Focus on paraphrasing text related to: {context}. Try to use terminology and phrasing common in this domain."
    rules: |
      Generate exactly {n_paraphrases} unique paraphrases that preserve the original meaning while using different words and sentence structures.
      Each paraphrase should be:
      - Each paraphrase must preserve the original meaning
      - Use different vocabulary and sentence structures
      - Preserve context and domain relevance
      - Make each paraphrase unique and natural
      - {length_instruction}
    task: "Text to paraphrase: {text}"
    thinking_step: "Consider synonyms, sentence restructuring, and varying lengths before you respond."
    output_format: |
      Provide the paraphrases as a list. Example:
      ["Paraphrase 1", "Paraphrase 2", "Paraphrase 3"]

    task_context: "You are a negation expert. Transform sentences to express their opposite meaning while maintaining grammatical correctness and naturalness."
    background_data:
      context: "Focus on negating sentences in the context of: {context}"
      preserve_style: "Maintain the original style and formality level of the text."
    rules: |
      Generate exactly {n_variations} negated version(s) that:
      - Express the opposite meaning of the original sentence
      - Are grammatically correct and natural-sounding
      - Preserve the original style and formality level
      - Use appropriate negation words (not, never, no, don't, can't, etc.)

    task: "Original sentence to negate: {text}"
    thinking_step: "Consider the main meaning of the sentence and how to express its opposite while keeping it natural and grammatically correct."
    output_format: |
      Provide the negated sentences as a list. Example:
      ["Negated sentence 1", "Negated sentence 2", "Negated sentence 3"]
