## Motivation

[SAIUnit](https://github.com/chaobrain/saiunit) (/saɪ ˈjuːnɪt/) is designed to provide physical units and unit-aware mathematical systems tailored for **S**cientific **AI** within JAX. In this context, Scientific AI refers to the use of AI models or tools to advance scientific computations. SAIUnit evolves from our [BrainUnit](https://github.com/chaobrain/brainunit), a unit framework originally developed for brain dynamics modeling, extending its capabilities to support a broader range of scientific computing applications. SAIUnit is committed to providing rigorous and automatic physical unit conversion and analysis system for general AI-driven scientific computing. 



## Features

Compared to existing unit libraries, such as [Quantities](https://github.com/python-quantities/python-quantities) and [Pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint), SAIUnit introduces a rigorous physical unit system specifically designed to support AI computations (e.g., automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, and parallelization). Its unique advantages include:

- Integration of over 2,000 commonly used physical units and constants
- Implementation of more than 500 unit-aware mathematical functions
- Deep integration with JAX, providing comprehensive support for modern AI framework features including automatic differentiation (autograd), just-in-time compilation (JIT), vectorization, and parallel computation
- Unit conversion and analysis are performed at compilation time, resulting in zero runtime overhead
- Strict physical unit type checking and dimensional inference system, detecting unit inconsistencies during compilation

    D --> D4[Parallelization]
```

We hope these features establish SAIUnit as a reliable physical unit handling solution for general AI-driven scientific computing scenarios.

A quick example:

```python

import saiunit as u

# Define a physical quantity
x = 3.0 * u.meter
x
# [out] 3. * meter

# autograd
f = lambda x: x ** 3
u.autograd.grad(f)(x)
# [out] 27. * meter2 


# JIT
import jax
jax.jit(f)(x)
# [out] 27. * klitre

# vmap
jax.vmap(f)(u.math.arange(0. * u.mV, 10. * u.mV, 1. * u.mV))
# [out]  ArrayImpl([  0.,   1.,   8.,  27.,  64., 125., 216., 343., 512., 729.]) * mvolt3
```



## Installation

``saiunit`` has been well tested on ``python>=3.9`` + ``jax>=0.4.30`` environments, and can be installed on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

You can install ``saiunit`` via pip:

```bash
pip install saiunit --upgrade
```

which should install in about 1 minute. If you want to install the latest version from the source, you can clone the repository and install it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaobrain/saiunit.git
cd saiunit
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, you can install `BrainX`, which bundles `saiunit` with other compatible packages for a comprehensive brain modeling ecosystem:

```bash
pip install BrainX -U
```
