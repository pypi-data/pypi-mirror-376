# Gemini Code Assistant Context

This document provides context for the Gemini Code Assistant to understand the `sphere-n` project.

## Project Overview

`sphere-n` is a Python library for generating low-discrepancy sequences on n-dimensional spheres. These sequences are useful for applications requiring uniformly distributed points on a sphere, such as computer graphics, numerical integration, and Monte Carlo simulations.

The library provides two main implementations:

*   `SphereN`: The primary implementation, which uses a recursive approach to generate points on spheres of any dimension (2 or higher).
*   `CylindN`: An alternative implementation using cylindrical mapping, mainly for comparison purposes.

The core logic relies on the `lds-gen` library for low-discrepancy sequence generation and `numpy` for numerical operations.

## Building and Running

The project uses a standard Python setup with `setuptools` and `pyscaffold`.

### Dependencies

The main dependencies are:

*   `numpy`
*   `lds-gen`

Test dependencies include:

*   `pytest`
*   `pytest-cov`
*   `scipy`

### Installation

To install the project and its dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install .
```

For development, install the testing dependencies as well:

```bash
pip install .[testing]
```

### Running Tests

The tests are located in the `tests` directory and can be run using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests compare the dispersion of points generated by `SphereN` and `CylindN` with random point generation.

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The project uses `flake8` for linting. The configuration is in the `.flake8` file.
*   **Testing:** The project uses `pytest` for testing. Tests are located in the `tests` directory. The `test_sp_n.py` file contains the main tests for the `SphereN` and `CylindN` classes.
*   **Structure:** The project follows the `pyscaffold` structure, with the main source code in `src/sphere_n`. The `Sphere3` class has been merged into `SphereN` to reduce code duplication.
