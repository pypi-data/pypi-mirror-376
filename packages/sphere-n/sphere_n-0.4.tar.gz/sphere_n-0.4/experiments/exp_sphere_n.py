exp_sphere3.py

This code is designed to compare how well three different methods can generate
points on a sphere, and then measure how "spread out" those points are.

The input(s) it takes are:

- The number of points to generate (in this case, 2001)
- The dimension of the space where these points will be generated (in this
  case, 4)

As for what output(s) it produces, the code generates three sets of points on a
sphere using different methods: one set is randomly generated, another set
follows a specific pattern called a Hopf generator, and the third set uses a
custom method. It then measures how "spread out" each set of points is.

To achieve its purpose, the code first defines two functions to generate these
sets of points: sample_spherical generates random points on a sphere, while
dispersion calculates how spread out a set of points are. The code then uses
these functions to create three sets of points and calculate their dispersion
values.

The important logic flow in this code is the way it measures the dispersion of
each set of points. Dispersion is like a measure of how "spread out" or
"scattered" the points are. The code does this by creating triangles from the
points, calculating the area of these triangles, and then averaging them to get
an idea of how spread out the points are.

One important data transformation happening in this code is the way it converts
the generated points into a format that can be used to calculate their
dispersion. This involves converting the points from a 4-dimensional space into
a set of coordinates that can be used by the dispersion function.

Overall, exp_sphere3.py is designed to compare how well different methods can
generate points on a sphere and measure how spread out those points are.
