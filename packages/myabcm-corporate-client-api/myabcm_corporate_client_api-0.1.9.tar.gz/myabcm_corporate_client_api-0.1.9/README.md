# MyABCM Corporate Python client API


## Overview

MyABCM Corporate (v12 or newer) provides a simple and extensive REST API for end users to connect and control MyABCM from other languages.

The purpose of this package is to simplify the usage of MyABCM Corporate REST API by wrapping the most common calls in a simple to use Python class.



## A bit of history

MyABCM Corporate since its first versions, provided a REST API so users could control it from external systems/programs.

To make the use of the REST API simpler, MyABCM even released a command line utility named "MyABCM.Client.Shell" that used the provided REST API to control the basic functions of MyABCM Corporate.

The initial goal of "MyABCM.Client.Shell" was to serve as a simple example of the potential of MyABCM Corporate API but many users ended up using the utility in production to automate processes like model imports, calculation and fact/cube generation.

MyABCM.Client.Shell certainly served its purpose, but it is limited in flexibility as it does not implement the functionality of a full scripting language. Due to that limitation came the idea of implementing a Python package that could wrap around MyABCM Corporate REST API and make it easier for end users to control MyABCM Corporate from Python scripts.



## How does it work?

This package implements a single class named **CorporateServer** that implements multiple methods to control MyABCM Corporate. 

Here is a simple example of a Python script to connect to MyABCM and calculate a model:

```python
from myabcm_corporate_client_api import CorporateServer

# Create a new instance of CorporateServer class with the provided servername and credentials
corporate_server = CorporateServer("https://corporate.my-company.com/proxy", "user123", "myabcm123")

# Logon to MyABCM Corporate
corporate_server.logon()

# Select a model 
corporate_server.select_model("MY-MODEL-REFERENCE-ABC")

# Execute calculation
corporate_server.calculate_model("JAN2025", "ACTUAL" , False)

# Logoff from MyABCM Corporate
corporate_server.logoff()
```

> This python package is designed to connect to the version **v1** of the server API, so when you inform the API URL, you must not inform the API version (as it is already embedded inside the Python code). If just for example, the "API URL" returned by **Abm.Server.WEB.Shell.exe LIST_PARAMETERS** returns ***myabcm.mycompany.com/v1***, you should use ***myabcm,mycompany.com*** without the ***v1***

## Methods provided by the CorporateServer class

Here are all methods exposed by the CorporateServer class. Additional details on the parameters required for each method can be obtained directly from most Python code editors as the source code of the package is fully documented using *Docstrings*.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

> With the exception of **process_fact_associations**, all other methods are executed synchronously. This means if you call a method like **execute_import**, **execute_export** or any other method that executes as an operation in the server, the call will block until the operation ends.
