# ymago: Advanced Generative AI Media Toolkit


ymago is a powerful, asynchronous command-line interface (CLI) and Python library designed for developers and creators. It provides a sophisticated, streamlined workflow to harness Google's cutting-edge generative AI models, including Nano Banana for image synthesis and Veo for video generation.
Engineered to the highest professional standards, ymago is more than just a CLI wrapper. It's a complete toolkit for scalable, reproducible, and integrable media generation.

## ‚ú® Key Features


ymago is packed with features designed for power, flexibility, and a superior user experience.
* Multi-Modal Generation: Natively supports both image and video creation using state-of-the-art Gemini models.
* Rich Interactive CLI: Enjoy a modern terminal experience with beautiful progress bars, status spinners, and formatted output powered by rich.
* Asynchronous Core: Built with aiohttp for non-blocking, concurrent API requests, enabling high throughput for batch operations.
* Flexible Inputs: Generate from text prompts or image URLs. ymago automatically downloads and processes remote images for you.
* Powerful Batch Processing: Submit hundreds of generation jobs from a single CSV or JSON file, perfect for large-scale asset creation.
* Advanced Generation Control: Fine-tune your creations with direct CLI access to model parameters like --seed, --negative-prompt, --aspect-ratio, and more.
* Composable Python API: Beyond the CLI, ymago is a well-structured library. Import and use its core functions in your own Python applications for programmatic generation.
* Cloud Integration: Save generated media directly to Cloudflare R2,  Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3, returning the public URL for seamless integration into cloud-native workflows.
* Webhook Notifications: For long-running jobs, configure a webhook URL to receive a notification the moment your media is ready.
* Configuration Files: Set default models, output paths, and API keys in a ymago.toml file for a cleaner, faster workflow.
* Built-in Resilience: Automatically retries failed API requests with exponential backoff using tenacity.
* Metadata Embedding: Automatically saves the generation prompt and key parameters to a JSON sidecar file, ensuring your creations are always reproducible.

## üíª Usage Examples




### 1. Basic Image Generation


Generate an image with a simple prompt and see the interactive progress.



```bash
ymago image "A photorealistic portrait of an astronaut on Mars" --output-path ./astro.png
```


### 2. Advanced Image Generation


Use advanced parameters and upload the result directly to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.


```bash
ymago image "A majestic wolf howling at a full moon, fantasy art" \
 --negative-prompt "daylight, clouds, cartoon" \
 --seed 42 \
 --upload-to gs://my-art-bucket/wolves/
```


### 3. Batch Processing from a File


Define multiple jobs in a prompts.csv file and run them all at once.


```csv
prompt,output_name
"A sunny beach with a palm tree","beach_day"
"A dark, rainy city street at night","rainy_night"
```


```bash
ymago batch --from-file ./prompts.csv --output-dir ./generated_images/
```


### 4. Using ymago as a Python Library


The core logic is easily importable into your own projects.


```python
import asyncio
from ymago.core import generate_image
from ymago.config import settings
```

# Ensure API key is configured in the environment or a config file
settings.load_config()

async def main():
   image_data = await generate_image(
       prompt="A vibrant coral reef teeming with life",
       model="gemini-nano-banana"
   )
   with open("coral_reef.png", "wb") as f:
       f.write(image_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
   asyncio.run(main())

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Future Roadmap


ymago is architected for scalability and extensibility, with a clean separation between the CLI interface and the core generation service.
The future roadmap focuses on building a robust, distributed generation system:
   * Pluggable Backends: The current "local" execution backend will be complemented by a Google Cloud Tasks backend. This will allow the CLI to instantly offload thousands of tasks to a managed queue, with a separate fleet of cloud workers handling the generation. The architecture is designed to easily support other backends like Celery in the future.
   * Serverless Workers: Generation tasks will be executed by scalable, serverless workers (e.g., Google Cloud Run or AWS Lambda), ensuring you only pay for what you use.
   * Decoupled Workflow: The combination of a task queue, serverless workers, cloud storage, and webhooks creates a fully decoupled, resilient, and scalable media generation pipeline suitable for production use.
