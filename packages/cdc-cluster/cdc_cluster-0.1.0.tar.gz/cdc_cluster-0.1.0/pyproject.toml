version = "0.1.0"
description = "A novel Clustering algorithm by measuring Direction Centrality (CDC) locally. It adopts a density-independent metric based on the distribution of K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) to distinguish between internal and boundary points. The boundary points generate enclosed cages to bind the connections of internal points."
