#
# This script is a support module for a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) project.
#
# ## Functions
#
# - `compute_displacement(point, pointf)`: 
#
#   Given two arrays of points, this function calculates the displacement between corresponding points. 
#   Input arrays should be the same length. Returns an array of (x,y) displacement vectors.
#
# - `compute_disp_and_remove_rigid_transform(p1, p2)`: 
#
#   Given two sets of 2D points (in the form of numpy arrays), this function computes the optimal rotation 
#   and translation between the two sets using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It then removes the rigid 
#   transform and returns the displacement between the two point sets.
#
# - `remove_point_outside(points, area, *args, **kwargs)`: 
#
#   This function removes points from a list that are outside a specified rectangular area.
#
# ## Classes
#
# - `AreaSelector`: 
#
#   This class allows for the selection of an area of interest in an image using OpenCV. The area can be selected 
#   by left-clicking and dragging the mouse, and pressing the 'c' key to confirm the selection.
#
#   - `pick_area_of_interest()`: 
#
#     This method opens a window with the image and allows the user to select an area of interest. The method 
#     returns the coordinates of the selected area.
#
#   - `click_and_crop(event, x, y, flags, param)`: 
#
#     This method handles the mouse events for selecting the area of interest.
