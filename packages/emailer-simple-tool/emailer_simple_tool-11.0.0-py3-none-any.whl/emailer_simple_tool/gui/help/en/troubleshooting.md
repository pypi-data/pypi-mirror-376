## Campaign Issues

### Campaign Won't Load

#### Symptoms
- "Campaign not found" errors
- Files appear to exist but aren't recognized
- Validation always shows red status

#### Diagnosis Steps

**Check File Names**
Required files must be named exactly:
- `recipients.csv` (not Recipients.csv or recipients.CSV)
- `subject.txt` (not subject.TXT)
- `msg.txt` or `msg.docx` (not message.txt)

**Check File Permissions**
```bash
ls -la campaign-folder/
# All files should be readable (r-- in permissions)
```

**Verify File Contents**
- **recipients.csv**: Open in text editor, check for proper CSV format
- **subject.txt**: Should contain subject line text
- **msg.txt**: Should contain email message

#### Common Solutions

**File Naming Issues**
1. Rename files to exact required names
2. Check for hidden file extensions (Windows)
3. Ensure no extra spaces in filenames

**Permission Problems**
1. **Windows**: Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Full Control
2. **macOS/Linux**: `chmod 644 campaign-folder/*`
3. Move campaign to user's home directory

**File Format Issues**
1. **CSV saved as Excel**: Re-save as CSV format
2. **Text encoding**: Save files as UTF-8 encoding
3. **Line endings**: Use appropriate line endings for your OS

### CSV File Problems

#### Invalid CSV Format

**Symptoms**
- "Invalid CSV format" error
- Personalization not working
- Missing recipient data

**Common CSV Issues**

**Missing Headers**
```csv
# Wrong - no header row
john@example.com,John Doe,ACME Corp

# Correct - header row present
email,name,company
john@example.com,John Doe,ACME Corp
```

**Incorrect Separators**
```csv
# Wrong - semicolon separated
email;name;company
john@example.com;John Doe;ACME Corp

# Correct - comma separated
email,name,company
john@example.com,John Doe,ACME Corp
```

**Extra Quotes or Commas**
```csv
# Wrong - extra quotes
"email","name","company"
"john@example.com","John Doe","ACME Corp"

# Correct - no extra quotes needed
email,name,company
john@example.com,John Doe,ACME Corp
```

**Empty Rows**
```csv
# Wrong - empty rows

email,name,company
john@example.com,John Doe,ACME Corp

# Correct - no empty rows
email,name,company
john@example.com,John Doe,ACME Corp
```

#### Fixing CSV Issues

**Use Text Editor**
1. Open CSV in plain text editor (Notepad, TextEdit)
2. Check format visually
3. Fix any obvious issues
4. Save as plain text

**Re-create from Excel**
1. Open data in Excel
2. File ‚Üí Save As ‚Üí CSV (Comma delimited)
3. Choose UTF-8 encoding if available
4. Don't use Excel format (.xlsx)

**Validate CSV Online**

- Copy/paste small samples to test
- Fix issues before using in campaign

### Personalization Not Working

#### Symptoms
- Variables like `{{name}}` appear literally in emails
- Some recipients get blank fields
- Inconsistent personalization results

#### Diagnosis

**Check Variable Names**
```
Template: Hello {{name}}, welcome to {{company}}!
CSV headers: email,name,company
Result: ‚úÖ Variables match headers

Template: Hello {{Name}}, welcome to {{Company}}!
CSV headers: email,name,company  
Result: ‚ùå Case mismatch (Name vs name)
```

**Check CSV Data**
```csv
email,name,company
john@example.com,John Doe,ACME Corp     ‚úÖ Complete data
jane@example.com,,Tech Solutions        ‚ùå Missing name
bob@example.com,Bob Wilson,             ‚ùå Missing company
```

#### Solutions

**Fix Variable Case**

- Use lowercase in both: `{{name}}` and CSV header `name`
- Check for typos in variable names

**Clean CSV Data**
- Fill in missing data where possible
- Use placeholder text for missing fields
- Remove recipients with critical missing data

**Test with Simple Example**
1. Create minimal CSV with just email and name
2. Use simple template: `Hello {{name}}`
3. Test dry run to verify personalization works
4. Gradually add complexity

## SMTP and Email Issues

### Connection Problems

#### "Connection Failed" Errors

**Check Basic Settings**
- **Server**: Correct SMTP server address
- **Port**: Usually 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL)

**Test Network Connection**
```bash
# Test if server is reachable
ping smtp.gmail.com

# Test if port is open (Linux/macOS)
telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
```

**Common Server Settings**
```
Gmail:
- Server: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587
- Security: TLS
