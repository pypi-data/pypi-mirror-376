# Release Notes - Emailer Simple Tool v5.0.1

**Release Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Patch Version**: 5.0.1 - Critical GUI Launch Fix  
**Theme**: GUI Command Handler Bug Fix

## 🚨 Critical Bug Fix

Version 5.0.1 addresses a **critical issue** in version 5.0.0 where the GUI command was not working properly, preventing users from launching the graphical interface.

## 🐛 What Was Fixed

### GUI Command Not Working
- **Issue**: Running `emailer-simple-tool gui` would do nothing or show no response
- **Root Cause**: Missing command handler in the CLI module for the `gui` subcommand
- **Impact**: Users could not access the new GUI interface introduced in v5.0.0
- **Severity**: Critical - Core feature completely non-functional

### Technical Details
The CLI parser included the `gui` subcommand definition but was missing the actual handler function, causing the command to be silently ignored.

## ✅ What's Fixed in v5.0.1

### 🔧 GUI Command Handler Implementation
- **Added**: Missing `handle_gui_command()` function in `src/emailer_simple_tool/cli.py`
- **Added**: Proper command routing for `gui` subcommand in main CLI parser
- **Enhanced**: Comprehensive error handling for GUI launch failures
- **Improved**: Clear user feedback for successful and failed GUI launches

### 📱 Enhanced User Experience
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear guidance when GUI dependencies are missing
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation messages when GUI launches successfully
- **Diagnostic Support**: Improved error reporting for troubleshooting

### 🛠️ Reliability Improvements
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Proper handling when PySide6 is not installed
- **Clear Instructions**: Helpful installation guidance for GUI support
- **Error Recovery**: Better error handling prevents CLI crashes

## 🚀 How to Update

### For Existing Users
```bash
# Update to the fixed version
pip install emailer-simple-tool[gui] --upgrade

# Test the GUI command
emailer-simple-tool gui
```

### For New Users
```bash
# Install with GUI support
pip install emailer-simple-tool[gui]

# Launch the GUI
emailer-simple-tool gui
```

## ✅ Verification

After updating, you should be able to:

1. **Run the GUI command successfully**:
   ```bash
   emailer-simple-tool gui
   ```
   
2. **See success messages**:
   ```
   🚀 Launching Emailer Simple Tool GUI...
   🚀 Emailer Simple Tool GUI launched successfully!
   ```

3. **GUI window appears**: A large window (1400x900) with 4 tabs should open

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you still have issues after updating:

### GUI Dependencies Missing
```bash
# Install GUI support explicitly
pip install PySide6
# or
pip install emailer-simple-tool[gui] --force-reinstall
```

### Command Not Found
```bash
# Reinstall the package
pip uninstall emailer-simple-tool
pip install emailer-simple-tool[gui]
```

### GUI Window Not Visible
- Check if the window opened behind other applications
- Look for the window in your taskbar/dock
- Try Alt+Tab (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Tab (Mac) to find the window
