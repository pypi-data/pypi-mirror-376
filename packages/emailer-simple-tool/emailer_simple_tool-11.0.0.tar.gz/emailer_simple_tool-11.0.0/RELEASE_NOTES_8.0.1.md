## ✨ What's New

### 🎨 **Enhanced Picture Generator Tab Layout**

#### **Optimized Two-Column Design**
- **Left Column (400px)**: Compact, logical grouping of core controls
  - fusion.csv + Browse/Open buttons (same line)
  - template.jpg + Browse/Open buttons (same line)
  - Email attachment checkbox
  - File management buttons: [Add Files] [Add Folder] [Open] (same line)

- **Right Column**: Maximized additional files list
  - Full height utilization for better file visibility
  - Smart scroll bars (horizontal & vertical as needed)
  - Professional appearance with clean borders

#### **Enhanced User Help Section**
- **50% height increase**: 200px → 300px
- **Better readability**: More comprehensive guidance visible
- **Critical for non-technical users**: Easier access to instructions

### 🔧 **Critical Bug Fixes**

#### **Attachment Checkbox Fix**
- **Issue**: Checkbox automatically unchecked itself after user clicked it
- **Root Cause**: Qt enum vs integer comparison bug (`state == Qt.Checked` failed)
- **Solution**: Proper state comparison (`state == 2` for checked state)
- **Result**: Checkbox now stays checked when user clicks it ✅

#### **Version Display Fix**
- **Issue**: GUI showed hardcoded version "5.0.1" instead of actual "8.0.1"
- **Solution**: Dynamic version import from `__init__.py`
- **Result**: GUI always shows correct current version ✅

### 🎯 **User Experience Improvements**

#### **Button Text Visibility**
- **Increased left column width**: 300px → 400px
- **Result**: All button text fully visible, no more truncation

#### **Smart Scroll Bars**
- **Horizontal scrolling**: For long filenames
- **Vertical scrolling**: For many additional files
- **Appears only when needed**: Clean interface when not required

#### **Space Optimization**
- **Better column balance**: Optimal width distribution
- **Maximum file visibility**: More files shown without scrolling
- **Professional layout**: Modern, clean appearance
