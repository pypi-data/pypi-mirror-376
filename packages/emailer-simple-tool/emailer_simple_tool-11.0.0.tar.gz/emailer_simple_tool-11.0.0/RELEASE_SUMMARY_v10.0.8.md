# Release Summary v10.0.8

**Release Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Release Type**: Bug Fix Release  
**PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/emailer-simple-tool/10.0.8/  
**GitHub Tag**: v10.0.8

## ðŸ”§ Windows Text Rotation Fix

### Problem Resolved
Fixed a Windows-specific issue where rotated text positioned near the top edge of images was getting clipped at the bottom. This particularly affected large rotated text elements like "2025" at 102px font size with 8Â° rotation positioned at y=20.

### Technical Solution
Implemented intelligent positioning logic that:

1. **Detects Top-Edge Positioning**: Identifies text positioned near the top edge (y < 100 pixels)
2. **Smart Padding Calculation**: 
   - Base padding: 15% of font size (minimum 10px)
   - Angle-aware scaling: Normalized to 45Â° rotation
   - Formula: `int(max(10, font_size * 0.15) * abs(angle) / 45)`
3. **Directional Adjustment**:
   - **Near top edge**: Moves text DOWN to prevent clipping
   - **Other positions**: Maintains existing upward adjustment
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Only applies on Windows systems

### Real-World Impact
- **Before**: "2025" text at y=20 with 8Â° rotation â†’ bottom characters clipped
- **After**: "2025" text moved to y=22 â†’ complete character rendering
- **Preservation**: All other text positioning remains unchanged
