### Q: Can I use formatted text in my emails?

### Q: What if my emails go to spam?

- Don't use spam-like words in subject lines
- Keep your recipient list clean and relevant
- Ask recipients to check their spam folders initially

### Q: Can I send emails with attachments?

## Picture Generator Questions

**A:** It creates personalized images for each recipient using their data. For example, you could create name badges, certificates, or invitations with each person's name and details.
