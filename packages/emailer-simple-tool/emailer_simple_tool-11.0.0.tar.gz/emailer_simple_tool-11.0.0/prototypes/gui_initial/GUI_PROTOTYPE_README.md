### Architecture
```
EmailerGUI (Main Window)
├── CampaignTab (Campaign management)
├── SMTPTab (Email configuration)  
├── PictureTab (Picture generation)
└── SendTab (Email sending)
```

### Integration Points
The prototype shows where the existing CLI code would integrate:
- **Campaign loading** → `CampaignManager`
- **SMTP testing** → `smtp_helper`
- **Picture generation** → `PictureGenerator`
- **Email sending** → `EmailSender`

- **Progress simulation** - Shows how sending would look

### 🔄 Interactive Elements
- **File browsing** - Actually opens your file system
- **Form validation** - Real input checking
- **Tab navigation** - Full interface exploration
- **Button interactions** - All buttons respond

### 💡 Real Previews
