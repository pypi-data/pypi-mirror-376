# 🎨 GUI Initial Prototypes

This folder contains the **initial GUI prototypes** that were created to demonstrate what a graphical interface could look like for emailer-simple-tool.

## 📁 **Files in This Folder**

### **Prototype Files**
- `gui_complete.py` - Complete working prototype (monolithic)
- `gui_tabs.py` - Tab components (part 1)
- `gui_tabs_part2.py` - Tab components (part 2)
- `launch_gui.py` - Simple launcher script

### **Documentation**
- `GUI_PROTOTYPE_README.md` - Complete prototype documentation
- `GUI_PROTOTYPE_SUMMARY.md` - Summary and evaluation guide
- `GUI_LICENSE_COMPLIANCE.md` - PySide6 licensing information

## ⚠️ **Important Note**

These files were **moved here** because they represent the initial approach of putting GUI files at the project root, which is **not best practice**.

The **proper implementation** is now located in:
```
src/emailer_simple_tool/gui/
```

## 🎯 **Purpose of These Prototypes**

These files serve as:
- ✅ **Proof of concept** - Demonstrates GUI feasibility
- ✅ **Design reference** - Shows what the interface could look like
- ✅ **Feature catalog** - Documents all planned GUI features
- ✅ **User testing** - Can be used to gather feedback

## 🚀 **How to Use**

If you want to see the original prototype:

```bash
cd prototypes/gui_initial
pip install PySide6
python gui_complete.py
```

## 📈 **Evolution Path**

1. **Initial Prototype** (this folder) - Proof of concept
2. **Proper Structure** (`src/emailer_simple_tool/gui/`) - Production implementation
3. **Final Product** - Integrated with existing CLI

## 🎊 **Status**

- ✅ **Prototype Complete** - Demonstrates all planned features
- ✅ **Structure Fixed** - Moved to proper module organization
- 🔄 **Production Implementation** - In progress in proper location

---

*These prototypes successfully demonstrated that a professional GUI is achievable and valuable for the emailer-simple-tool project.*
