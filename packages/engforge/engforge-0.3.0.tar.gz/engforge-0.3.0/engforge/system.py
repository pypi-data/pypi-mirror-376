"""A System is a Configuration that orchestrates dataflow between components, as well as solving systems of equations in the presense of limits, as well as formatting results of each Component into reporting ready dataframe. System's solver behavior is inspired by NASA's numerical propulsion simulation system (NPSS) to solve systems of inequalities in complex systems.

Component or other subsystems are added to a System class with `Slots`:
    ```
    class CustomSystem(System):
        slot_name = Slot.define(Component,ComponentSubclass,System)
    ```

Component's data flow is established via `SignalS` that are defined:
    ```
    class CustomSystem(System):
        signal_name = Signal.define(source_attr_or_property, target_attr)
        control_signal = Signal.define(source_attr_or_property, target_attr,control_with='system.attr or slot.attr`)
    ```
    - source_attr: can reference a locally defined slot attribute (a la attr's fields) or any locally defined slot system property
    - target_attr: must be a locally defined slot attribute or system attribute.

update description to include solver

A system calculates its state upon calling `System.run()`. This executes `pre_execute()` first which will directly update any attributes based on their `Signal` definition between `Slot` components. Once convergence is reached target_attr's are updated in `post_execute()` for cyclic SignalS.

If the system encounters a subsystem in its solver routine, the subsystem is evald() and its results used as static in that iteration,ie it isn't included in the system level dependents if cyclic references are found.


The solver uses the root or cobla scipy optimizer results on quick references to internal component references. Upon solving the system

SignalS can be limited with constrains via `min or max` values on `NumericProperty` which can be numeric values (int or float) or functions taking one argument of the component it is defined on. Additionally signals may take arguments of `min` or `max` which are numeric values or callbacks which take the system instance as an argument.
