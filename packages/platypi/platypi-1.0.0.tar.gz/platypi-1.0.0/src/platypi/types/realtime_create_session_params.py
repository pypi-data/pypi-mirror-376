    Configuration for input audio transcription, defaults to off and can be set to
    `null` to turn off once on. Input audio transcription is not native to the
    model, since the model consumes audio directly. Transcription runs
    asynchronously and should be treated as rough guidance rather than the
    representation understood by the model.

    instructions: str
    """The default system instructions (i.e.

    system message) prepended to model calls. This field allows the client to guide
    the model on desired responses. The model can be instructed on response content
    and format, (e.g. "be extremely succinct", "act friendly", "here are examples of
    good responses") and on audio behavior (e.g. "talk quickly", "inject emotion
    into your voice", "laugh frequently"). The instructions are not guaranteed to be
    followed by the model, but they provide guidance to the model on the desired
    behavior. Note that the server sets default instructions which will be used if
    this field is not set and are visible in the `session.created` event at the

    the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user
    speech.

    Voice cannot be changed during the session once the model has responded with
