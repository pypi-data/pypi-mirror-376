    Stream obfuscation adds random characters to an `obfuscation` field on streaming

    attacks. These obfuscation fields are included by default, but add a small
    amount of overhead to the data stream. You can set `include_obfuscation` to
    false to optimize for bandwidth if you trust the network links between your
