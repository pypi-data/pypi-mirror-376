=========
MacroStat
=========


    A Package providing multiple tools for the statistical analysis and treatment of macroeconomic simulation models, with a particular focus on Agent-based and Stock-Flow Consistent Models


The purpose of this project is to provide a statistical toolbox for the analysis of Agent-based Models. The toolbox is developed in `python` and aims to provide a simple interface for researchers to attach their model, such that simulations can be steered from within the toolbox and the relevant analysis can be run (such as sensitivities, confidence intervals, and simulation studies). Only the analysis itself requires `python`, while the models can be written in any language.

The code was developed using Python 3.10. Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed

Installation
============

This project requires Python v3.10 or later.

To install the latest version of the package from PyPI::

    pip install macrostat

Or, directly from GitHub::

   pip install git+https://github.com/KarlNaumann/MacroStat.git#egg=macrostat

If you'd like to contribute to the package, please read the CONTRIBUTING.md guide.

Making Changes & Contributing
=============================

This project uses `pre-commit`_, please make sure to install it before making any changes::

    pip install pre-commit
    cd MacroStat
    pre-commit install

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version::

    pre-commit autoupdate

Don't forget to tell your contributors to also install and use pre-commit.
