## Overview

Auto SRP helps alliances and corporations manage ship replacement submissions, reviews,
and payouts end to end. Automatically. Without user submissions.

## Key Features

- FC-driven submissions
  - Pilots do not submit losses, FCs (or users with the submit permission) create SRP reports.
  - Automatic: paste a zKill “related” link or a **_(beta)_** EVE Tools BR link to auto-fill systems and time.
  - Manual: specify systems and time window, the expected doctrine, and eligible alliances/corporations (org filter.

  - FCs have access to see reports they have submitted.

- Doctrine fit matching (https://gitlab.com/colcrunch/fittings)
  - Losses are matched against doctrine fits automatically.
  - Reviewers can change the selected fit and re-run the fit check at any time.

- Payout calculation and overrides
  - Suggested payouts are computed from base rewards (if configured, otherwise it uses market data) with configurable penalty schemes.
  - Reviewers can override the payout per kill when needed.
  - The application provides a detailed report of the match, including the doctrine, the fit, and the payout. Simply click details.

- Review workflow
  - Add or remove kills from a report, then approve or reject with optional comments.

  - If the character is attached to the user in AA and they have Discord configured, the user will be notified on approval/rejection (including comments).
    - Users can disable this notification on an individual level.

- Configurable penalties
  - Define penalty schemes (per-missing/wrong module), optionally include rigs/subsystems, and set a max cap.

- Flexible rewards
  - Set base rewards per doctrine and ship, enabling fixed payouts independent of market prices.
