DisplayCAL Python 3 Project
===========================

This project intended to modernize the DisplayCAL code including Python 3 support.

Florian HÃ¶ch, the original developer, did an incredible job of creating and maintaining
DisplayCAL for all these years. But, it seems that, during the pandemic, very
understandably, he lost his passion to the project. Now, it is time for us, the
DisplayCAL community, to contribute back to this great tool.

This project is based on the ``HEAD`` of the Sourceforge version, which had 5 extra
commits that Florian has created over the ``3.8.9.3`` release on 14 Jan 2020.

Thanks to all the efforts put by the community DisplayCAL is now working with Python
3.9+:
