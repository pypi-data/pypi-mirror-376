## Overview

This tool allows users to:
- Load directories containing worldCamera.mp4 recordings and gazeData.tsv files
- View eye tracking videos with gaze position overlays
- Create, mark and manage time-based event annotations
- Save annotations to CSV files for further analysis

## Data Preparation

**Important**: Before using Zarafe, you need to convert your eye tracking data:

Zarafe uses [glassesValidator](https://github.com/dcnieho/glassesValidator) to import your eye tracking data. Some eye trackers require preprocessing before importing:

- **Pupil Labs**: Export from Pupil/Neon Player (disable World Video Exporter) or Pupil Cloud
- **Meta Project Aria Gen 1**: Process in Aria Studio with MPS eye gaze run, then use provided export script
- **SMI ETG**: Export raw data and scene video from BeGaze with specific settings

For detailed preprocessing instructions for your specific eye tracker, see the [glassesValidator preprocessing guide](https://github.com/dcnieho/glassesValidator?tab=readme-ov-file#eye-trackers).

The import process will generate the required worldCamera.mp4 and gazeData.tsv files.

Zarafe expects a specific directory structure with each recording in its own folder containing both files.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mh-salari/zarafe.git
   cd zarafe
   ```

2. Install dependencies (choose one method):

   **Option A: Using uv (recommended)**
   ```bash

   # Install dependencies
   uv sync
   ```

   **Option B: Using pip**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
