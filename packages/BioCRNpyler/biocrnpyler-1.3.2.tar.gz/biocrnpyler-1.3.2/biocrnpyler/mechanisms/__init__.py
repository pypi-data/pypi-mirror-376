"""BioCRNpyler mechanism library.

Mechanisms in BioCRNpyler define "reaction schemas" that describe the
biochemical processes generating species and reactions during model
compilation. They sit between the abstract design of
:ref:`components<components_ref>` and the concrete chemical reactions
and species described in the :ref:`core_ref` section.
