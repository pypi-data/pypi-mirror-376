"""BioCRNpyler component library (including DNA components).

Components are the primary building blocks of models in BioCRNpyler.
They represent biomolecular parts or motifs such as promoters,
enzymes, transcriptional units, or complexes, and serve as an
abstraction layer above the core chemical species and reactions
defined in the :mod:`biocrnpyler.core` module.
