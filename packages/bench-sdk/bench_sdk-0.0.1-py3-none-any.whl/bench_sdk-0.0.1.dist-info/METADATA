# 🛠️ Bench SDK

**The SDK for building AI-powered engineering automation**

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/bench-sdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/bench-sdk)

## 🎯 What is Bench SDK?

The Bench SDK is your gateway to building next-generation engineering automation powered by AI. Whether you're automating CAD workflows, running parallel simulations, or optimizing designs across multiple dimensions, the Bench SDK makes it feel like you have a team of 1000 engineers at your fingertips.

**Note:** This is a placeholder package for the actual Bench SDK that's currently in development. The real SDK will provide actual integration with CAD/CAE tools and the Bench AI platform.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install bench-sdk
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

```python
from bench_sdk import BenchSDK, AgentConfig

# Initialize the SDK
sdk = BenchSDK("your-api-key")
sdk.connect()

# Create an AI engineering agent
agent_config = AgentConfig(
    name="TurboOptimizer",
    capabilities=["CAD automation", "FEA simulation", "Generative design"],
    acceleration_factor=1000  # Because why not?
)
agent = sdk.create_agent(agent_config)

# Execute engineering tasks at light speed
result = agent.execute("Optimize heat exchanger design")
# Watch as days of work complete in milliseconds!

# Run tasks in parallel across the multiverse
results = agent.parallel_execute([
    "Generate 100 design variations",
    "Run CFD analysis on all variants",
    "Select optimal configuration"
])
```

## 🎮 CLI Commands

The SDK comes with a fun CLI to explore its capabilities:

```bash
# Run the interactive quickstart demo
bench-sdk quickstart

# See simulated API calls in action
bench-sdk api-demo

# Optimize a CAD model (simulation)
bench-sdk optimize --model turbine_blade

# Create and run an AI agent
bench-sdk agent --name "RocketOptimizer" --task "Design optimal nozzle geometry"

# Get SDK info
bench-sdk info
```

## 📚 Core Components

### 🤖 Agents
AI-powered agents that can execute engineering tasks:

```python
from bench_sdk import AgentConfig, BenchSDK

config = AgentConfig(
    name="DesignBot",
    capabilities=["CAD", "Simulation", "Optimization"],
    parallel_universes=42  # Explore 42 design spaces simultaneously
)
agent = sdk.create_agent(config)
```

### 🔄 Workflows
Define and automate complex engineering workflows:

```python
workflow = sdk.define_workflow(
    "complete_design_cycle",
    steps=[
        "Generate initial geometry",
        "Run structural analysis", 
        "Optimize for manufacturing",
        "Validate performance",
        "Generate documentation"
    ]
)
workflow.run(agent)
```

### 🎯 CAD Optimizer
Optimize your CAD models with AI:

```python
from bench_sdk import CADOptimizer

result = CADOptimizer.optimize(
    "complex_assembly",
    constraints={
        "max_weight": "10kg",
        "min_safety_factor": 3.0,
        "manufacturing_method": "CNC"
    }
)
```

## 🌟 Features (Coming Soon in the Real SDK)

- **Real CAD/CAE Integration**: Connect with SolidWorks, Fusion 360, ANSYS, and more
- **Cloud Compute**: Run massive parallel simulations in the cloud
- **Version Control**: Git-like version control for CAD models
- **Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration on engineering projects
- **API Access**: RESTful API for building custom integrations
- **Webhooks**: Get notified when workflows complete
- **Custom Agents**: Train agents on your specific engineering domain

## 🏗️ What We're Actually Building

At [Bench AI](https://getbench.ai), we're creating a platform that:

- Integrates with your existing CAD/CAE/PLM tools
- Deploys AI agents that understand engineering workflows
- Automates repetitive design tasks
- Enables parallel exploration of design spaces
- Reduces iteration cycles from days to minutes
