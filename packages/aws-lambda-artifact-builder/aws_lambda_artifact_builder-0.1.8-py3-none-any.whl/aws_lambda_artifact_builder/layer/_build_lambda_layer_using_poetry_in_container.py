"""
Container-based Lambda layer build script for Poetry dependency management.

This script follows the same container orchestration pattern as the pip variant.
For detailed documentation on the container build architecture, execution flow,
and integration with the builder classes, see:

**Execution Flow**

1. Install ``poetry`` cli inside the container
2. Install ``aws_lambda_artifact_builder`` library inside the container
3. Use the ``Builder`` class to execute the build logic.

**EXECUTION SAFETY**

THIS SCRIPT HAS TO BE EXECUTED IN THE CONTAINER, NOT ON THE HOST MACHINE.

The script validates its execution environment by checking that it's running from
``/var/task``, which is where the Docker container mounts the host project directory.
This prevents accidental execution on the host system where paths and environment
would be incorrect.
