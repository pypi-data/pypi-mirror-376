"""
Container-based Lambda layer build script for pip dependency management.

This script is designed to execute inside AWS SAM build containers as part of the
:class:`~aws_lambda_artifact_builder.layer.pip_builder.PipBasedLambdaLayerContainerBuilder` workflow.
It bridges the gap between host system and container environment by replicating local build logic
inside a Docker container that matches AWS Lambda's exact runtime environment.

**Execution Flow**

1. Install ``aws_lambda_artifact_builder`` library inside the container
2. Use the ``Builder`` class to execute the build logic.

**EXECUTION SAFETY**

THIS SCRIPT HAS TO BE EXECUTED IN THE CONTAINER, NOT ON THE HOST MACHINE.

The script validates its execution environment by checking that it's running from
``/var/task``, which is where the Docker container mounts the host project directory.
This prevents accidental execution on the host system where paths and environment
would be incorrect.
