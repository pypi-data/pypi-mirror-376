# Aiobmsble
Requires Python 3 and uses [asyncio](https://pypi.org/project/asyncio/) and [bleak](https://pypi.org/project/bleak/)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the moment the library is under development and there might be missing functionality compared to the [BMS_BLE-HA integration](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA/)!
> Please do not (yet) report missing BMS support or bugs here. Instead please raise an issue at the integration till the library reached at least development status *beta*.

## Asynchronous Library to Query Battery Management Systems via Bluetooth LE
This library is intended to query data from battery management systems that use Bluetooth LE. It is developed to support [BMS_BLE-HA integration](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA/) that was written to make BMS data available to Home Assistant. While the integration depends on Home Assistant, this library can be used stand-alone in any Python environment (with necessary dependencies installed).

## Usage
In order to identify all devices that are reachable and supported by the library, simply run
```bash
aiobmsble
```
from the command line after [installation](#installation). In case you need the code as reference, please see [\_\_main\_\_.py](/aiobmsble/__main__.py).

### From a Script
This example can also be found as an [example](/examples/minimal.py) in the respective [folder](/main/examples).
```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main(NAME))  # pragma: no cover
```

## Installation
Install python and pip if you have not already, then run:
```bash
pip3 install pip --upgrade
pip3 install wheel
```

### For Production:

```bash
pip3 install aiobmsble
```
This will install the latest library release and all of it's python dependencies.

### For Development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/patman15/aiobmsble.git
cd aiobmsble
pip3 install -e .[dev]
```
This gives you the latest library code from the main branch.
