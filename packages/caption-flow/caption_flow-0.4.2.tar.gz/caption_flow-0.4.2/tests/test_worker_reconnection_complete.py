"""Complete test for worker reconnection sequence assignment issues.

This test demonstrates:
1. The actual problem: Workers getting reassigned the same chunks (red)
2. The storage defense: Duplicate job_id detection prevents data corruption
3. The real issue: Inefficient duplicate work assignment
4. A solution approach: Better chunk assignment logic (green)
