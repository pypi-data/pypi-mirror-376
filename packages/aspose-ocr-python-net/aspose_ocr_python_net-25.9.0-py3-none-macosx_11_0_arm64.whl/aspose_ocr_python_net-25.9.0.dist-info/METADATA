Seamlessly integrate advanced optical character recognition into your Python projects with ease. Designed for all-in-one functionality and developer-friendly simplicity, this solution enables you to convert images, scans, PDFs, illustrations, and screenshots into accurate, editable, and searchable text with just a few lines of code. Convert scanned documents into searchable, indexable PDFs, extract and compare text from images, and streamline workflows with unmatched precision and performance. Aspose OCR API is suitable for prototypes, cross-platform applications, and cloud services.

## What is optical character recognition (OCR)?

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts images of printed or handwritten text into machine-readable, editable, and searchable digital text. By analyzing shapes and patterns within an image, OCR identifies characters—letters, numbers, and symbols—and translates them into text that computers can process. This powerful technology enables the extraction of information from physical documents, images, and forms, transforming them into actionable digital data. OCR also plays a vital role in accessibility, providing visually impaired individuals access to text through screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Recognition languages

Aspose OCR is the perfect solution for global applications and multi-lingual documents. With support for nearly [all languages](https://docs.aspose.com/ocr/python-net/recognition-languages/), it ensures accurate text extraction across a wide range of scripts and alphabets. 
Our engine excels at handling mixed-language documents, such as those featuring both Chinese and English, and can automatically detect the language of the input text during recognition.

- Extended Latin (English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and other European languages)
- Cyrillic (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, and more)
- Arabic and Persian
- Chinese
- Hindi and other Devanagari-based scripts
- Korean
- Japanese

Aspose OCR can also extract text from handwritten notes and street photos.

## Key features

- **Universal** – Effortlessly extract text from any image, whether it's a high-quality scan or a casual street photo, captured via scanner or camera.  
- **Fast** – Achieve rapid text recognition, processing a page in just seconds with minimal resource consumption. Adjust recognition speed, quality, and resource usage according to your specific needs.  
- **Developer-friendly** – With just a few lines of code, easily convert images to text, create searchable PDFs, save recognition results to documents, and more, integrating OCR into your workflows seamlessly.  
- **Modular** – Maintain a lean and efficient application by selectively incorporating advanced features from our comprehensive resource repository.  
- **Reliable** – Experience exceptional recognition accuracy, even with challenging images that are blurry, rotated, distorted, or noisy.  

## Supported file formats

Aspose OCR can handle nearly any file format from scanners or cameras, including:

- JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF images
- Single-page and multi-page TIFF files
- PDF documents
- DjVu files

All above-mentioned files can be read directly from web links. You can also use Aspose OCR to perform bulk recognition on images within folders and archives, streamlining large-scale document processing.

The recognition results are returned in popular file and data exchange formats, enabling easy storage, database import, or real-time analysis:

- Plain Text
- Searchable PDF
- Microsoft Word or Excel documents
- HTML
- RTF
- ePUB
- JSON and XML
- Markdown

## Platforms

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

## Developer-friendly

Aspose OCR is designed by developers for developers, offering a straightforward and intuitive interface. You only need 6 lines of code to convert image to text:

```python
import aspose.ocr as ocr
# Initialize OCR engine
api = AsposeOcr()
# Add images to recognition batch
input = OcrInput(InputType.SINGLE_IMAGE)
input.add("1.png")
# Recognize images
results = api.recognize(input)
# Print result
print(results[0].recognition_text)
```

## Licensing

You can begin using the Aspose OCR library immediately after installation. In evaluation mode (without providing a license), you can recognize text in any supported language and save recognition results in all supported formats, with a few limitations:

- If the number of characters in a recognized image exceeds 300, only the first 300 characters will be recognized.
- If the number of characters is fewer than 300, only the first 60% of the characters will be recognized.

To unlock all features, [request a temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license), which removes all trial limitations for 30 days. This gives you the opportunity to build a fully functional OCR application and evaluate Aspose.OCR before making your final [purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/pricing/ocr/python-net/) decision.
