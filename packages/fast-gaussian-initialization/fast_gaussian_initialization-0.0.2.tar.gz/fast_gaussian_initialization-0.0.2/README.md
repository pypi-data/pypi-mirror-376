# Fast Gaussian Initialization (FGI)

This is FastGI library, designed for rapid CPU-based
initialization of 3D Gaussian Splatting models.

Key features include:
- Flexible PLY file loading (PlyFile)
- Greedy clustering of point clouds (Fit class)
- Gaussian fitting with GMM or fast PCA fallback
- Export to standard 3DGS PLY format
- Basic test renderer (test_render)
- Open3D viewer integration (view_ply)

Adds pyproject.toml for packaging and dependency management.

I'll add way more information later :)
Version 0.0.2, btw!
