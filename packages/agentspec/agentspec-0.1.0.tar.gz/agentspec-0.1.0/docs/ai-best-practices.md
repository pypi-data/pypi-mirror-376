## Best Practices Summary

### The Golden Rules

1. **Never commit code you don't fully understand** - Ultimate responsibility remains with the developer
2. **Maintain continuous validation** - Test, inspect, and verify all AI-generated code
3. **Use incremental complexity** - Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
4. **Implement security guardrails** - Protect against the 10x increase in security risks
5. **Invest in prompt engineering** - Quality prompts produce quality code
6. **Follow crawl-walk-run adoption** - Build organizational capability gradually

### The Productivity Paradox

Research shows AI developers write 3-4x more code but generate 10x more security problems. The key is scaling security and governance capabilities alongside productivity gains.

### Success Metrics

- **Quality**: Zero-tolerance for linting, compilation, and security errors
- **Security**: Comprehensive guardrail coverage and compliance adherence  
- **Productivity**: Sustainable velocity with maintained code quality
- **Adoption**: Successful organizational culture transformation
- **Learning**: Continuous improvement in AI collaboration skills
