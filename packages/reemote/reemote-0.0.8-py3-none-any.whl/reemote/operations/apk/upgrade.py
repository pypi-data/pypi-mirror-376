class Upgrade:
    """
    A class to manage package operations on a remote system using `apk` (Alpine Linux package manager).

    Attributes:
        sudo (bool): If `True`, the commands will be executed with `sudo` privileges.
        su (bool): If `True`, the commands will be executed with `su` privileges.

    **Examples:**

    .. code:: python

        class Upgrade_example:
            def execute(self):
                from reemote.operations.apk.upgrade import Upgrade
                # Upgrade the packages on all hosts
                r = yield Upgrade()

    Usage:
        Upgrade installed packages.

    Notes:
        - Commands are constructed based on the `present`, `sudo`, and `su` flags.
        - The `changed` flag is set if the package state changes after execution.
