"""
Quantum Routing Engine - Phase 2 Implementation

This module implements the advanced quantum routing capabilities for the Monkey Coder
platform, providing intelligent AI model selection using Deep Q-Network (DQN)
algorithms, multi-strategy parallel execution, comprehensive performance metrics,
and Redis-based caching for optimal routing decisions.

Phase 2 Features:
- Enhanced DQN Agent with neural network implementation
- Experience Replay Buffer with prioritized sampling
- Quantum Routing Manager with multi-strategy execution
- Comprehensive performance metrics and analytics
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Redis-based intelligent caching system

Built on proven multi-agent patterns and adapted for the
Monkey Coder platform's specific routing requirements.
