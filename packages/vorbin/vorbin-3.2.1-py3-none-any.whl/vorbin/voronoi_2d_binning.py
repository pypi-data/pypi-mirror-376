    For example sn_func() could be a procedure which uses ppxf to measure
    the velocity dispersion from the coadded spectrum of spaxels "index"
    and returns the relative error in the dispersion.

    Perform adaptive spatial binning of 2D data to reach a chosen constant S/N per bin.

    `Cappellari & Copin (2003) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.342..345C>`_.

    Calling Sequence
    ----------------
    .. code-block:: python

        from vorbin.voronoi_2d_binning import voronoi_2d_binning

        bin_number, x_gen, y_gen, x_bar, y_bar, sn, nPixels, scale = voronoi_2d_binning(
            x, y, signal, noise, target_sn, cvt=True, pixelsize=None, plot=True,
            quiet=True, sn_func=None, wvt=True)


    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like with shape (npix,)
        A vector containing the X coordinates of the pixels to be binned.
        Arbitrary units can be used (e.g., arcseconds or pixels). In this
        context, "pixel" refers to a single spatial element of the dataset,
        sometimes called a "spaxel" in integral-field spectroscopy. It is
        assumed that the pixels are arranged on a regular grid; however, this
        grid can contain holes (pixels excluded from the binning) and have
        an irregular boundary.
    y : array_like with shape (npix,)
        A vector containing the Y coordinates of the pixels to be binned.
    signal : array_like with shape (npix,)
        A vector containing the signal associated with each pixel at coordinates
        ``(x, y)``. For an integral-field spectrograph, the signal could be the
        average flux in the spectral range of interest. For a CCD image, it
        would simply be the counts in each pixel.
    noise : array_like with shape (npix,)
        A vector containing the corresponding noise (1-sigma error) for each
        pixel. While ``signal`` and ``noise`` are typically used to compute the
        binning, the S/N can also be calculated on-the-fly using the ``sn_func``
        keyword. To create bins with approximately equal total signal, one can
        assume Poissonian noise by setting ``noise = np.sqrt(signal)``.
    target_sn : float
        The desired signal-to-noise ratio for the final 2D-binned data. For
        example, a ``S/N`` of ~50 per spectral pixel is often a reasonable
        target for extracting stellar kinematics from galaxy spectra.

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    cvt : bool, optional
        Set to ``False`` to skip the Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT)
        step (vii) of the algorithm from `Cappellari & Copin (2003)`_. This
        can be useful if the noise is strongly non-Poissonian, if the pixels
        are not optimally weighted, or if the CVT step appears to introduce
        significant gradients in the S/N. An alternative is to set ``wvt=True``.
    plot : bool, optional
        Set to ``True`` to generate a plot of the 2D bins and their
        corresponding S/N values at the end of the computation.
    pixelsize : float, optional
        The pixel scale of the input data, which could be the size of a CCD
        pixel or a spaxel/lenslet in an integral-field spectrograph. This
        value is computed automatically by the program if not provided, but
        doing so can be time-consuming for large datasets. In such cases,
        it is recommended to provide the ``pixelsize`` value.
    sn_func : callable, optional
        A generic function to calculate the S/N of a bin composed of spaxels
        at a given ``index``. The function must have the following signature::

            sn = func(index, signal, noise)

        If ``sn_func=None``, the binning will use the default ``_sn_func()``,

        which implements equation (2) of `Cappellari & Copin (2003)`_.
        However, a more general user-defined function can be provided.

        The value returned by ``sn_func()`` does not need to be an analytical
        function of S and N, nor does it need to be the actual S/N. Instead,
        it can be any quantity that the user wishes to equalize across the bins.
        For example, ``sn_func()`` could be a procedure that uses ``ppxf`` to
        measure the velocity dispersion from the coadded spectrum of the spaxels
        at ``index`` and returns the relative error in the dispersion.

        Note that using an analytical approximation of S/N, like the default,
        will significantly speed up the calculation. For more details, refer
        to the docstring of ``_sn_func()`` in the ``voronoi_2d_binning.py`` file.
    quiet : bool, optional
        By default, the program displays progress updates while accreting pixels
        and iterating the CVT. Set ``quiet=True`` to suppress these messages.
    wvt : bool, optional
        When ``wvt=True``, the ``bin2d_cvt_equal_mass`` routine is modified as
        proposed by Diehl & Statler (2006, MNRAS, 368, 497). In this case, the
        final step of the algorithm, following the bin-accretion stage, is a
        Weighted Voronoi Tessellation instead of a modified Centroidal Voronoi
        Tessellation. This may be beneficial if the noise is strongly
        non-Poissonian, if the pixels are not optimally weighted, or if the CVT
        step appears to introduce significant S/N gradients. An alternative is
        to set ``cvt=False``. If you set ``wvt=True``, please include a
        reference to "the WVT modification proposed by Diehl & Statler (2006)."

    Returns
    -------
    bin_number : array_like with shape (npix,)
        A vector containing the bin number assigned to each input pixel, with
        indices ranging from zero to ``nbin - 1``.

        IMPORTANT: This vector is all that is needed for any subsequent
        computations on the binned data. All other returned values are optional
        and can be disregarded.
    x_gen : array_like with shape (nbin,)
        A vector of the X coordinates of the bin generators. These generators
        provide an alternative way of defining the Voronoi tessellation.

        NOTE: The use of this vector is deprecated as it can be a source of
        confusion.
    y_gen : array_like with shape (nbin,)
        A vector of the Y coordinates of the bin generators.

        NOTE: The use of this vector is deprecated as it can be a source of
        confusion.
    x_bar : array_like with shape (nbin,)
        A vector of the X coordinates of the luminosity-weighted centroids of
        the bins.
    y_bar : array_like with shape (nbin,)
        A vector of the Y coordinates of the luminosity-weighted centroids of
        the bins.
    sn : array_like with shape (nbin,)
        A vector of the final S/N for each bin.
    nPixels : array_like with shape (nbin,)
        A vector of the number of pixels in each bin.
    scale : array_like with shape (nbin,)
        A vector of the scale length for each bin. This is needed to
        reconstruct the tessellation if `wvt=True`.

    Binning should not be used blindly when some pixels contain significant
    noise but virtually no signal. This situation may happen e.g. when
    extracting the gas kinematics from observed galaxy spectra. One way of
    using ``voronoi_2d_binning`` consists of first selecting the pixels with
    ``S/N`` above a minimum threshold and then binning each set of connected
    pixels *separately*. Alternatively one may optimally weight the pixels
    before binning. For details, see Sec. 2.1 of `Cappellari & Copin (2003)`_.

    Binning X-ray data
    ------------------
    For X-ray data, or other data coming from photon-counting devices the noise
    is generally accurately Poissonian. In the Poissonian case, the S/N in a
    bin can never decrease by adding a pixel [see Sec.2.1 of
    `Cappellari & Copin (2003)`_], and it is preferable to bin the data
    *without* first removing the observed pixels with no signal.

    Binning very big images
    -----------------------
    Computation time in voronoi_2d_binning scales nearly as npixels^1.5, so it
    may become a problem for large images (e.g. at the time of writing
    ``npixels > 1000x1000``). Let's assume that we really need to bin the image
    as a whole and that the S/N in a significant number of pixels is well above
    our target S/N. As for many other computational problems, a way to radically
    decrease the computation time consists of proceeding hierarchically. Suppose
    for example we have a 4000x4000 pixels image, we can do the following:

    1. Rebin the image regularly (e.g. in groups of 8x8 pixels) to a manageable
       size of 500x500 pixels;
    2. Apply the standard Voronoi 2D-binning procedure to the 500x500 image;
    3. Transform all unbinned pixels (which already have enough S/N) of the
       500x500 Voronoi 2D-binned image back into their original individual
       full-resolution pixels;
    4. Now apply Voronoi 2D-binning only to the connected regions of
       full-resolution pixels;
    5. Merge the set of lower resolution bins with the higher resolution ones.
