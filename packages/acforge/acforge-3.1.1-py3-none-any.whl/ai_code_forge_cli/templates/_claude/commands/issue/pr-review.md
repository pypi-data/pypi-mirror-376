# PR Review Analysis

Execute sequential three-agent pipeline for pull request analysis. Use $ARGUMENTS or auto-detect from current branch.

## Instructions

<scope_determination priority="CRITICAL">
<argument_processing>
if $ARGUMENTS provided:
  - Parse $ARGUMENTS
  - Fetch PR details using GitHub CLI: `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS`
  - Extract branch information and diff scope from PR data
else:
  - Auto-detect from current branch (feature/issue-N pattern)
  - Extract git log since branch diverged: `git log main...HEAD --oneline`
  - Use current branch vs base for analysis scope including commit history
</argument_processing>
<validation>
1. Validate git state: check for detached HEAD, merge conflicts, uncommitted changes
2. Determine analysis scope: specific PR or current branch changes
3. Extract appropriate diff using determined scope
4. Skip if >100 files changed (report size limit exceeded)
</validation>
</scope_determination>

<sequential_pipeline priority="CRITICAL">
<stage_1>
Task(context): Codebase context and architectural impact mapping
- Analyze determined diff scope and commit history for affected systems and dependencies
- Map integration points and architectural relationships  
- Identify scope of changes within codebase structure
- Consider commit progression and development patterns
- Output: Contextual foundation including change evolution for subsequent analysis
</stage_1>

<stage_2>
Task(researcher): Technical research using Stage 1 context findings
- Research implications using contextual mapping
- Investigate patterns, best practices, potential issues
- Analyze implementation approaches and alternatives
- Output: Technical analysis with domain knowledge
</stage_2>

<stage_3>
Task(critic): Risk assessment using all previous findings
- Review context + research findings for risks/issues
- Apply contrarian analysis to identify edge cases
- Challenge assumptions and highlight concerns
- Output: Final prioritized recommendations
</stage_3>
</sequential_pipeline>
