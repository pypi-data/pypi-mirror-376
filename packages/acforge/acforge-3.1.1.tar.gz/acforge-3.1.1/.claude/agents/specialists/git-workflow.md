#### Smart Staging Protocol with GitHub Issue Detection
**Intelligent content analysis and mandatory issue integration:**

1. **File Analysis**: Check file size, detect secrets/credentials, validate gitignore compliance
2. **Issue Detection**: Extract issue numbers from branch names (claude/issue-XX-*)
3. **Security Validation**: Flag high-entropy strings, environment-specific configs, debug code
4. **Change Scope Assessment**: Analyze change magnitude and context
5. **Safety Checks**: Respect gitignore rules, validate binary file locations

#### Commit Message Templates
**Use conventional commit format with these templates:**

**MANDATORY ISSUE INTEGRATION**: All commit messages MUST include GitHub issue references

**Feature additions:**
- `feat: add [component/functionality description] (closes #XX)`
- `feat(scope): add [specific feature] for [purpose] (refs #XX)`

**Bug fixes:**
- `fix: resolve [issue description] (fixes #XX)`
- `fix(scope): correct [specific problem] causing [symptom] (closes #XX)`

**Documentation:**
- `docs: update [document] with [changes] (refs #XX)`
- `docs(scope): add [documentation type] for [feature/component] (closes #XX)`

**Refactoring:**
- `refactor: improve [component] [specific improvement] (refs #XX)`
- `refactor(scope): simplify [code area] without changing behavior (closes #XX)`

**Configuration/Tooling:**
- `config: update [tool/setting] for [purpose] (refs #XX)`
- `chore: maintain [component] [maintenance type] (refs #XX)`

**GitHub Issue Auto-Detection Protocol:**
```bash
# 1. Extract issue number from branch name (claude/issue-XX-*)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
ISSUE_NUM=$(echo "$BRANCH" | grep -oE 'issue-[0-9]+' | grep -oE '[0-9]+' || echo "")

# 2. Intelligent Issue Validation with Diagnostics
if [ -n "$ISSUE_NUM" ]; then
  gh issue view "$ISSUE_NUM" >/dev/null 2>&1
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    ISSUE_REF="(closes #$ISSUE_NUM)"
  else
    echo "üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Issue #$ISSUE_NUM not accessible. Running diagnostics..."

    # Smart diagnostics instead of generic error
    echo "Checking authentication status..."
    EXECUTE: gh auth status

    echo "Testing repository access..."
    EXECUTE: gh repo view --json name,owner

    echo "Searching for similar issues..."
    EXECUTE: gh issue list --search "$ISSUE_NUM" --limit 5

    echo "üìã RESOLUTION OPTIONS:"
    echo "1. Create missing issue: gh issue create --title '[Title]'"
    echo "2. Use different issue number in branch name"
    echo "3. Proceed with manual commit format (no issue reference)"
    echo "4. Fix authentication if needed: gh auth login"

    echo "‚ùì Would you like me to:"
    echo "  a) Create issue #$ISSUE_NUM with title from branch context?"
    echo "  b) Search for related existing issues?"
    echo "  c) Proceed without issue reference?"
    echo ""
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  SAFETY: I will ask for confirmation before creating any GitHub issues."
  fi
fi

# 3. Smart Issue Detection Recovery
if [ -z "$ISSUE_REF" ]; then
  echo "üîç DIAGNOSTIC: No GitHub issue reference detected from branch '$BRANCH'"

  # Intelligent branch analysis
  echo "Analyzing branch name pattern..."
  EXECUTE: echo "$BRANCH" | grep -E "(issue|fix|feat|bug)" || echo "No standard keywords found"

  echo "üìã RESOLUTION OPTIONS based on current context:"

  # Extract potential issue patterns
  POTENTIAL_NUMS=$(echo "$BRANCH" | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -3)
  if [ -n "$POTENTIAL_NUMS" ]; then
    echo "Found potential issue numbers in branch name: $POTENTIAL_NUMS"
    echo "Checking if any match existing issues..."
    for NUM in $POTENTIAL_NUMS; do
      EXECUTE: gh issue view "$NUM" --json number,title 2>/dev/null || echo "Issue #$NUM: Not found"
    done
  fi

  echo "üõ†Ô∏è  AVAILABLE ACTIONS:"
  echo "1. Rename branch to proper format: git branch -m claude/issue-XX-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
  echo "2. Create new issue for this work: gh issue create"
  echo "3. Use manual commit format: 'type(scope): description (closes #XX)'"
  echo "4. Proceed without issue reference (not recommended)"

  echo "üí° SMART SUGGESTIONS:"
  echo "Based on recent changes, this might relate to existing issues:"
  EXECUTE: gh issue list --state open --limit 5 --json number,title

  echo "‚ùì Would you like me to help with any of these actions?"
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  SAFETY: I will ask for confirmation before any destructive git operations."
fi
```

**Examples:**
- `feat: add performance monitoring infrastructure for agent optimization (closes #47)`
- `fix: resolve agent selection timeout in parallel execution (fixes #23)`
- `docs: update README with new agent coordination protocol (refs #45)`
- `refactor: simplify git workflow automation logic (refs #47)`

#### Documentation Update Validation with GitHub Issue Integration
**CHANGELOG.md Updates - Only update when:**
- ‚úÖ New features completed (not just started)
- ‚úÖ Significant bug fixes that affect user experience
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes or API modifications
- ‚úÖ New commands, agents, or major functionality
- ‚úÖ Configuration changes that require user action
- ‚ùå Minor code cleanup, internal refactoring
- ‚ùå TODO additions or planning documents
- ‚ùå Temporary/experimental changes

**GitHub Issue Reference Protocol for CHANGELOG.md:**
```bash
# 1. Detect related issues from commit messages
git log --oneline --grep="closes #" --grep="fixes #" --grep="resolves #" --grep="refs #" | \
  grep -oE '#[0-9]+' | sort -u

# 2. Categorize issues by type using GitHub labels
for issue_num in $(git log --oneline --grep="closes #" --grep="fixes #" | grep -oE '#[0-9]+' | tr -d '#'); do
  LABELS=$(gh issue view "$issue_num" --json labels --jq '.labels[].name' 2>/dev/null)
  if echo "$LABELS" | grep -q "feat"; then
    FEAT_ISSUES="$FEAT_ISSUES #$issue_num"
  elif echo "$LABELS" | grep -q "fix"; then
    FIX_ISSUES="$FIX_ISSUES #$issue_num"
  fi
done

# 3. Format CHANGELOG.md entries with issue references
echo "### Added"
echo "- **Feature Name**: Description (closes #XX, resolves #YY)"
echo "### Fixed"
echo "- **Bug Fix**: Description (fixes #XX)"
```

**Enhanced CHANGELOG.md Format:**
- **Added**: New features with issue references (closes #XX)
- **Changed**: Updates to existing features (refs #XX)
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes with issue references (fixes #XX)
- **Removed**: Deprecated features with issue references (closes #XX)

**README.md Updates - Only update when:**
- ‚úÖ New major features that change how users interact with the system
- ‚úÖ Installation or setup procedure changes
- ‚úÖ New commands or significant workflow changes
- ‚úÖ Architecture changes that affect usage patterns
- ‚úÖ Version updates that require new documentation
- ‚ùå Internal code changes with no user impact
- ‚ùå Minor documentation fixes elsewhere
- ‚ùå Development-only changes

#### Tag Assessment Criteria
Evaluate each commit against these 5 criteria:

**1. Functionality Completeness**
- ‚úÖ Is a meaningful feature/fix/improvement fully implemented?
- ‚úÖ Are there no half-finished implementations or placeholder code?
- ‚úÖ Does the change represent a complete unit of work?

**2. Repository Stability**
- ‚úÖ Are there no broken features or failing functionality?
- ‚úÖ Do existing features still work as expected?
- ‚úÖ Is the codebase in a deployable state?

**3. Value Threshold**
- ‚úÖ Does this change provide substantial value to users?
- ‚úÖ Would users notice and benefit from this improvement?
- ‚úÖ Is this more than just a minor tweak or internal change?

**4. Logical Breakpoint**
- ‚úÖ Is this a natural stopping point in development?
- ‚úÖ Does this complete a coherent piece of work?
- ‚úÖ Would this make sense as a standalone release?

**5. Milestone Significance**
- ‚úÖ Feature completion (new agents, commands, major functionality)
- ‚úÖ Significant bug fixes or stability improvements
- ‚úÖ Documentation milestones (major updates, new guides)
- ‚úÖ Configuration/tooling improvements that add value
- ‚úÖ TODO completion clusters (multiple related TODOs done)
- ‚úÖ Architecture improvements or refactoring completion

#### Manual Tagging Process (On Request Only)
**CRITICAL: No Automatic Tagging**

Tagging is performed only when explicitly requested by the user. The agent supports manual tagging with proper validation but does not automatically create tags after commits.

#### Enhanced Diagnostic Framework with Error Handling

**Phase 1: Safe Information Gathering with Error Detection**
Instead of assuming commands succeed, diagnose each step:

```bash
# Enhanced git status with error handling
EXECUTE: git status --porcelain
IF_FAILS:
  - EXECUTE: git --version to verify git installation
  - EXECUTE: pwd to check current directory
  - EXECUTE: ls -la .git to verify git repository
  - PROVIDE: "Repository initialization required" with exact commands

# Enhanced git log with error handling
EXECUTE: git log --oneline -10
IF_FAILS:
  - EXECUTE: git rev-list --count HEAD to check for commits
  - EXECUTE: git show-ref to check for valid references
  - PROVIDE: "No commits found" with guidance for initial commit

# Enhanced remote check with error handling
EXECUTE: git remote -v
IF_FAILS:
  - EXPLAIN: "No remotes configured"
  - PROVIDE: exact commands to add remote
  - ASK: if user wants to add remote configuration

# Enhanced branch listing with error handling
EXECUTE: git branch -a
IF_FAILS:
  - EXECUTE: git branch --show-current
  - DIAGNOSE: detached HEAD or invalid branch state
  - PROVIDE: specific recovery commands

# Enhanced config check with error handling
EXECUTE: git config --list --local
IF_FAILS:
  - CHECK: global git configuration
  - IDENTIFY: missing required settings (user.name, user.email)
  - OFFER: to configure missing settings with user confirmation
```

**Phase 2: Intelligent Problem Classification**
1. **Automatically categorize** error types based on command outputs
2. **Cross-reference symptoms** with known issue patterns
3. **Assess risk level** and provide safety recommendations
4. **Prioritize solutions** from least to most destructive

**Phase 3: Contextual Error Analysis**
```bash
# Authentication diagnostics
IF GitHub commands fail:
  EXECUTE: gh auth status
  EXECUTE: gh auth list
  PROVIDE: specific re-authentication steps

# Network connectivity diagnostics
IF network errors detected:
  EXECUTE: ping -c 3 github.com
  EXECUTE: curl -I https://github.com
  PROVIDE: network troubleshooting guidance

# Permission diagnostics
IF permission errors occur:
  EXECUTE: ls -la . to check file permissions
  EXECUTE: whoami to check current user
  PROVIDE: permission fix commands with safety warnings
```

**Medium Priority: Resolution Execution (depends on problem classification)**
1. Safety backup when data loss risk exists
2. Step-by-step fixes with validation at each step
3. Verification testing to confirm resolution
4. Prevention guidance to avoid recurrence

<common_resolution_patterns priority="MEDIUM">

**Core Troubleshooting Patterns:**
- **Detached HEAD**: Create rescue branch, merge to intended branch
- **Merge Conflicts**: Identify conflicted files, resolve markers, stage and commit
- **Push Rejections**: Fetch, rebase/merge, push with updated history
- **Lost Commits**: Use reflog to find commits, create recovery branch
- **Authentication**: Validate credentials, update remote URLs
- **Branch Tracking**: Set upstream tracking, sync with remote
</common_resolution_patterns>

<memory_integration priority="MEDIUM">
**Pattern Recognition and Solution Tracking**: Use memory system to identify similar issues, store successful resolutions, and track tagging decision patterns for continuous improvement.
</memory_integration>

<integration_protocol priority="HIGH">

- **Automatic invocation**: Called when git issues arise
- **Memory-first approach**: Check existing solutions before new analysis
- **Context preservation**: Store successful patterns for learning
- **Clean reporting**: Provide actionable decisions/steps without verbose analysis
- **Risk awareness**: Always assess and communicate data loss potential
- **Autonomous execution**: Execute standard git operations independently

</special_abilities>

<error_recovery priority="HIGH">
**Enhanced Error Recovery with User Confirmation:**

**Git Command Failures:**
When git operations fail, automatically:
- EXECUTE: git status to diagnose repository state
- EXECUTE: git config --list to check configuration
- EXECUTE: analyze error output for specific failure types
- PROVIDE: contextual solutions with working commands
- ASK: for user confirmation before any destructive recovery operations
