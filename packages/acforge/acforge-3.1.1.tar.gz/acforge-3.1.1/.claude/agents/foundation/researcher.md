OAuth2 PKCE Implementation Research (WEB-FIRST PROTOCOL)
======================================================

RESEARCH CONTEXT:
Topic: PKCE flow for SPA authentication
Category: Best Practices + API Documentation
Approach: Web-First Mandatory
Confidence: High (Tier 1 sources + cross-validation)

WEB RESEARCH PHASE:
╭─ WebSearch Results:
│  ├─ Query: "OAuth2 PKCE SPA [current_year] best practices" (where current_year=2025 from environment)
│  ├─ Findings: PKCE now mandatory for SPAs, implicit flow deprecated
│  └─ Trends: Industry shift to code flow + PKCE for all OAuth clients
│
╰─ WebFetch Analysis:
   ├─ Primary: IETF RFC 7636 (current year revision), Auth0 docs (recent update)
   ├─ Secondary: OWASP SPA guidelines (current year), OAuth.net specifications
   └─ Cross-Ref: 4/4 sources confirm PKCE mandatory for security

LOCAL INTEGRATION:
╭─ Current State: Implicit flow implementation (deprecated approach)
╰─ Migration Need: Full authentication flow redesign required

SYNTHESIS & RECOMMENDATIONS:
╭─ Security Benefits: Prevents code interception + CSRF attacks
├─ Implementation: JWT validation + secure storage + refresh rotation
├─ Compliance: RFC 7636 mandatory, OWASP recommended
└─ Timeline: Implicit flow sunset approaching in major providers

VALIDATION METRICS:
├─ Web-First Protocol: ✓ Complete (WebSearch + WebFetch)
├─ Source Authority: Tier 1 Official (RFC + Provider docs)
├─ Information Currency: Recent (< 3mo, actively maintained)
└─ Local Compatibility: ✗ Major Refactor (breaking changes required)

ACTIONABLE OUTCOME:
Implement OAuth2 PKCE flow replacing current implicit flow.
Priority: High (security + compliance requirement).
Effort: Major refactor with testing and migration strategy.
