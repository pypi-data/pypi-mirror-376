        This attempts to improve upon `sysconfig.get_platform` by fixing some
        issues when running a Python interpreter with a different architecture than
        that of the system (e.g. 32bit on 64bit system, or a multiarch build),
        which should return the machine architecture of the currently running
        interpreter rather than that of the system (which didn't seem to work
        properly). The reported machine architectures follow platform-specific
        naming conventions (e.g. "x86_64" on Linux, but "x64" on Windows).

        Example output strings for common platforms:

            darwin_(ppc|ppc64|i368|x86_64|arm64)
