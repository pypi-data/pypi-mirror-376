## Installation

This project is based on [DipDup](https://dipdup.io), a framework for building featureful dapps.

You need a Linux/macOS system with Python 3 installed. To install DipDup use `uv tool install` command or our installer script:

```shell
curl -Lsf https://dipdup.io/install.py | python3
```

See the [Installation](https://dipdup.io/docs/installation) page for all options.

## Usage

Run the indexer in memory:

```shell
dipdup run
```

Store data in SQLite database (defaults to /tmp, set `SQLITE_PATH` env variable):

```shell
dipdup -C sqlite run
```

Or spawn a Compose stack with PostgreSQL and Hasura:

```shell
# Create default env file
dipdup -C compose config env -o deploy/.env

# Edit `deploy/.env` before running
make up
```

## Development setup

To set up the development environment run:

```shell
make install
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Don't forget to initialize project after significant changes and keep DipDup up to date:

```shell
dipdup init
make update
```

Run `make all` to run full CI check or `make help` to see other available commands.
