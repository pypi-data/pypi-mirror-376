Content: Hi Matt,

I hope this message finds you well! My name is Devadas Pattathil, and I am the CEO of OnePint.ai. With over 25 years of experience in supply chain technology, including 8+ years at Walmart, I understand the challenges that brands like BarkBox face in managing inventory effectively.

As a leader in the dog food category, I know that ensuring product availability while minimizing costs is crucial for your business. Many brands struggle with inaccurate forecasting and disconnected planning tools, leading to inefficiencies and lost sales opportunities.

That’s why we developed **Pint Planning**, our AI-powered inventory planning platform designed to help brands like yours:
- Improve forecast accuracy by 30–50%
- Reduce out-of-stocks by up to 85%
- Lower inventory holding and supply chain costs by 20–30%

We’ve successfully partnered with various retailers to enhance their planning processes, making them smarter, faster, and more data-driven.

If modernizing your inventory planning and execution systems is on your agenda, I would love to discuss how OnePint.ai can support BarkBox in achieving its goals.

Would you be open to a quick chat? I’m happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,
