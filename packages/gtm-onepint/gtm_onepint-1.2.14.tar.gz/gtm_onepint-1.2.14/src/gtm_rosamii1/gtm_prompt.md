Product Information
At OnePint.ai, our mission is to build the smartest, most adaptive inventory management platform—leveraging AI to help businesses lower costs, reduce stockouts, minimize excess, and keep customer promises with confidence.
In many companies, planning and execution operate in silos. Decisions made at the planning level often fail to adapt quickly to real-world changes in demand and fulfillment constraints. For large retailers, this disconnect leads to inefficiencies, excess inventory, and stockouts. For smaller brands, the gap is even wider—many still manage inventory using spreadsheets and gut instinct, without access to AI-driven forecasting or real-time visibility. Key features of the platform include: One Truth: Modern, Centralized Visibility: A unified source of truth for all inventory and availability data, both current and future. Control Center: Simulation-Based Decisioning: Real-time, autonomous AI agents that facilitate intelligent decision-making and continuous monitoring. Pint Planning: Intelligent, Autonomous Inventory Management: Tools to optimize availability, reduce inventory costs, and enhance planning forecasting, allocation and replenishment What sets OnePint.ai apart?
