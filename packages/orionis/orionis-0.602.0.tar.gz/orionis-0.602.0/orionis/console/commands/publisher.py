class PublisherCommand(BaseCommand):
    """
    PublisherCommand is a console command for automating the process of publishing a Python package to the Orionis repository (PyPI).

    This command performs the following steps:
        1. Runs the project's test suite and aborts if there are any test failures or errors.
        2. Bumps the minor version number in the file where the VERSION constant is defined.
        3. Commits and pushes changes to the Git repository if there are modifications.
        4. Builds the package distributions (source and wheel) using `setup.py`.
        5. Publishes the built distributions to PyPI using Twine and a token from environment variables.
        6. Cleans up temporary build artifacts and metadata directories after publishing.

    Attributes
    ----------
    timestamps : bool
        Indicates whether timestamps will be shown in the command output.
    signature : str
        Command signature ("publisher").
    description : str
        Command description.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(console: Console)
        Initializes the PublisherCommand instance, setting up the console, project root, console width, and PyPI token.
    __bumpMinorVersion()
        Increments the minor version number in the file where the VERSION constant is defined.
    __gitPush()
        Commits and pushes changes to the Git repository if there are modifications.
    __build()
        Builds the package distributions using `setup.py`.
    __publish()
        Publishes the built distributions to PyPI using Twine and a token from environment variables.
    __clearRepository()
        Cleans up temporary build artifacts and metadata directories after publishing.
    handle(reactor: IReactor) -> None
        Orchestrates the publishing process, running tests, bumping version, pushing to Git, building, and publishing the package.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This class does not return a value directly. The main workflow is executed via the `handle` method, which returns None.
