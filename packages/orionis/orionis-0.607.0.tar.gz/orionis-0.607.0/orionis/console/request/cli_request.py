        """
        Create a CLIRequest instance from a list of command line arguments.

        This class method provides a convenient way to construct a CLIRequest object
        directly from a list of command line arguments, such as those typically
        received from sys.argv. It parses the arguments according to common CLI
        conventions and extracts the command name and associated parameters.

        Parameters
        ----------
        args : list
            A list of command line arguments where the first element is expected
            to be the command name, and subsequent elements are command arguments
            in the format '--key=value', '--flag', or 'value'. Empty lists are
            handled gracefully with fallback behavior.

        Returns
        -------
        CLIRequest
            A new CLIRequest instance initialized with the parsed command name
            and arguments dictionary extracted from the input list.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> args = ['migrate', '--database=production', '--force', 'users']
        >>> request = CLIRequest.fromList(args)
        >>> request.command()
        'migrate'
        >>> request.argument('database')
        'production'
        >>> request.argument('force')
        'force'

        Notes
        -----
        The parsing logic follows these conventions:
        - First argument is always treated as the command name
        - Arguments with '=' are split into key-value pairs
        - Arguments starting with '--' have the prefix removed
        - Flag arguments (--flag) are stored with the flag name as both key and value
        - Regular arguments without '=' are stored with the argument as both key and value
        - Empty or single-element lists result in default command names and empty arguments
