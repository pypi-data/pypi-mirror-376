        are in the correct format. If validation passes, it creates and returns an
        Event object representing the scheduled command, including its signature,
        arguments, and description.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature : str
            The unique signature identifying the command to be scheduled. Must be a non-empty string.
        args : Optional[List[str]], optional
            A list of string arguments to be passed to the command. Defaults to None.
