        Initializes a new Reactor instance for command discovery and management.

        The Reactor constructor sets up the command processing environment by establishing
        the application context, determining the project root directory, and automatically
        discovering and loading command classes from the console commands directory.
        It maintains an internal registry of discovered commands for efficient lookup
        and execution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        app : Optional[IApplication], default None
            The application instance to use for command processing. If None is provided,
            a new Orionis application instance will be created automatically. The
            application instance provides access to configuration, paths, and other
            framework services required for command execution.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This is a constructor method and does not return any value. The instance
            is configured with the provided or default application and populated with
            discovered commands.

        Notes
        -----
        - Command discovery is performed automatically during initialization
        - The current working directory is used as the project root for module resolution
        - Commands are loaded from the path specified by app.path('commands')
        - The internal command registry is initialized as an empty dictionary before loading

        """
        Loads all available commands into the reactor's internal registry.

        This method ensures that all commands—custom user-defined, core framework, and fluent interface
        commands—are loaded and registered in the reactor's internal command registry. It uses internal
        flags to prevent duplicate loading and to optimize performance by ensuring each command set is
        loaded only once per reactor instance.

        The loading order is as follows:
            1. Core commands (if not already loaded)
            2. Custom user-defined commands (if not already loaded)
            3. Fluent interface commands (if not already loaded)

        This order allows custom commands to override core commands if they share the same signature,
        and ensures that all available commands are discoverable and executable.

        Parameters
        ----------
        None

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. All discovered commands are registered
            internally in the reactor's command registry and become available for execution.

        Notes
        -----
        - Each command set is loaded only once per reactor instance.
        - The internal flags `__load__core_commands`, `__load__custom_commands`, and
          `__load_fluent_commands` track the loading state of each command set.
        - Both loading methods handle their own error handling and validation.

        - Logs execution start, completion, and errors with timestamps if enabled.
        - Handles argument parsing and injects parsed arguments into the command instance.
        - All exceptions are logged and displayed in the console.
