            If None, returns the entire paths configuration dictionary. Default is None.

        Returns
        -------
        Path or dict
            If `key` is provided and found, returns the resolved `Path` object for that key.
            If `key` is None, returns a dictionary mapping all path keys to their `Path` objects.
            If `key` is not found, returns None.

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisRuntimeError
            If the application configuration has not been initialized (i.e., if `create()` has not been called).
        OrionisValueError
            If the provided `key` parameter is not a string.

        Notes
        -----
        - The method traverses the paths configuration structure by splitting the key on dots and navigating through dictionary levels.
        - This method is specifically designed for path-related configuration access, separate from general application configuration.
        - All returned paths are resolved as `Path` objects for consistency and ease of use.

        Bootstrap and initialize the complete application framework.

        This method orchestrates the entire application startup process including
        configuration loading, service provider registration and booting, framework
        kernel initialization, and logging setup. It ensures the application is
        fully prepared for operation and prevents duplicate initialization.

        Returns
        -------
        Application
            The current application instance to enable method chaining.

        Notes
        -----
        The bootstrap process follows this sequence:
        1. Load and process all configuration from configurators
        2. Register core framework service providers
        3. Register and boot all service providers
        4. Initialize framework kernels (Testing, CLI)
        5. Log successful startup with timing information
        6. Mark application as booted to prevent re-initialization

        This method is idempotent - calling it multiple times will not cause
        duplicate initialization. The startup time is calculated and logged
        for performance monitoring purposes.

        Check if the application is running in a production environment.

        This method determines whether the current application environment is set to 'production'.
        It checks the 'app.env' configuration value to make this determination.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if the application environment is 'production', False otherwise.

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisRuntimeError
            If the application configuration has not been initialized (i.e., if `create()` has not been called).

        Notes
        -----
        The environment is typically defined in the application configuration and can be set to values such as 'development', 'testing', or 'production'.
        This method is useful for conditionally executing code based on the environment, such as enabling/disabling debug features or logging verbosity.
