    Main application container that manages the complete application lifecycle.

    management, configuration handling, and application initialization. It implements
    a fluent interface pattern to enable method chaining for configuration setup.

    The Application class serves as the central orchestrator for the Orionis framework,
    managing the loading and booting of service providers, framework kernels, and
    various configuration subsystems such as authentication, caching, database,
    logging, and more.

        Configure all major application subsystems using configuration entities or dictionaries.

        This method provides a centralized interface for setting up the application's
        configuration by accepting configuration objects or dictionaries for each major
        subsystem. Each configurator parameter corresponds to a specific aspect of the
        application, such as authentication, caching, database, logging, mail, paths,
        queue, session, and testing. The method validates and loads each configurator
        into the application's configuration system.

        database : Database or dict, optional
            Database configuration (e.g., connections, migration settings).

            Defaults to a new Testing() instance.

        Returns
        -------
        Application
            The current Application instance, allowing for method chaining.

        Raises
        ------
        OrionisTypeError
            If any configurator parameter is not an instance of its expected type
            or a dictionary convertible to the expected type.

        Notes
        -----
        - Each configurator is validated and loaded using its corresponding load method.
        - This method does not perform deep validation of the contents of each configurator.
        - The method returns the Application instance itself for fluent chaining.
