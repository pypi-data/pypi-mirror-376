# The "cache" section is to build faster with cached dependencies. See:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started/pages_from_scratch.html#build-faster-with-cached-dependencies
# We also cache venv created with "before_script" to cache pip packages
# The "variable" section is to change pip's cache directory to be inside
# the project directory since we can only cache local items.
# The script can be simplified by removing "variables", "cache"
# and "before_script" but build will be slower
