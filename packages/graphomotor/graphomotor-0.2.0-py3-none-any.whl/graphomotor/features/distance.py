    """Calculate Hausdorff distance metrics for a spiral object.

    This function computes multiple features based on the Hausdorff distance between a
    drawn spiral and a reference (ideal) spiral, as described in [1]. Implementation
    is based on the original R script provided with the publication. The Hausdorff
    distance measures the maximum distance of a set to the nearest point in the other
    set. This metric and its derivatives capture various aspects of the spatial
    relationship between the drawn and reference spirals.

    Calculated features include:

    - **hausdorff_distance_maximum**: The maximum of the directed Hausdorff distances
      between the data points and the reference data points
    - **hausdorff_distance_sum**: The sum of the directed Hausdorff distances
    - **hausdorff_distance_sum_per_second**: The sum of the directed Hausdorff distances
      divided by the total drawing duration
    - **hausdorff_distance_interquartile_range**: The interquartile range of the
      directed Hausdorff distances
    - **hausdorff_distance_start_segment_maximum_normalized**: The maximum of the
      directed Hausdorff distances between the beginning segment (0% to 25%) of
      data points and the beginning segment of reference data points divided by
      the number of data points in the beginning segment
    - **hausdorff_distance_end_segment_maximum_normalized**: The maximum of the directed
      Hausdorff distances in the ending segment (75% to 100%) of data points and
      the ending segment of reference data points divided by the number of data
      points in the ending segment
    - **hausdorff_distance_middle_segment_maximum**: The maximum of the directed
      Hausdorff distances in the middle segment (15% to 85%) of data points and
      the ending segment of reference data points (this metric is not divided by
      the number of data points in the middle segment unlike previous ones)
    - **hausdorff_distance_middle_segment_maximum_per_second**: The maximum of the
      directed Hausdorff distances in the middle segment divided by the total
      drawing duration

    Args:
        spiral: Spiral object with drawing data.
        reference_spiral: Reference spiral data for comparison.

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing Hausdorff distance-based features.
