"""Visualization and plotting utilities for graphomotor data analysis.

This module provides comprehensive plotting functions for both feature visualization
and spiral trajectory visualization:

- **Feature Plots**: Distribution, trend, box, and cluster heatmap visualizations
- **Spiral Plots**: Individual and batch spiral trajectory visualizations for
  quality control and data inspection
- **Customizable Output**: Matplotlib figure objects for further customization
- **Batch Processing**: Support for multi-participant datasets

All plotting functions return matplotlib figure objects and support both CLI and
programmatic usage for flexible integration into analysis workflows.
