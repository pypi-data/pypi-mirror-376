        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or

        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

        By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
        to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
        Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
        extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
        granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
        these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
        consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
        Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
        
        
        Section 1 -- Definitions.
        
          a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
             Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
             and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
             arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
             permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
             Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
             Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
             Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
             synched in timed relation with a moving image.
        
          b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
             and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
             accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        
          c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
             closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
             performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
             Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
             categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
             specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
             Rights.
        
          d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
             absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
             fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
             Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
             agreements.
        
          e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
             any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
             that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
        
          f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
             or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
             License.
        
          g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
             terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
             all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
             Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
        
          h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
             under this Public License.
        
          i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
             process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
             as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
             dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
             available to the public including in ways that members of the
             public may access the material from a place and at a time
             individually chosen by them.
        
          j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
             resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
             the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.
        
          a. Attribution.
        
               1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                  form), You must:
        
                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:
        
                         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
        
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
               4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
                  License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
                  Material from complying with this Public License.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
        
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
             this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
             terminate automatically.
        
          b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
             Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
               1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                  it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                  violation; or
        
               2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
        
             For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
             right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
             of this Public License.
        
          c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
             Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
             distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
             will not terminate this Public License.
        
          d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
             License.
        
        
        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
        
          a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
             terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
        
          b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
             Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
             independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        
        
        Section 8 -- Interpretation.
        
          a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
             shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
             conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
             be made without permission under this Public License.
        
          b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
             deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
             minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
             cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
             without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
             conditions.
        
          c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no

Nanoscopy Python library (NanoPyx, the successor to NanoJ) - focused on light microscopy and super-resolution imaging

WARNING: Currently stable and working for Python 3.9 to 3.12. For Python 3.13, it is possible to use it if you build numpy<2 from source but it is not officially supported (Yet!)

---

## What is the NanoPyx 🔬 Library?

NanoPyx is a library specialized in the analysis of light microscopy and super-resolution data.
It is a successor to [NanoJ](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoJ-Core), which is a Java library for the analysis of super-resolution microscopy data.

NanoPyx focuses on performance, by using the [Liquid Engine](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/LiquidEngine) at its core. It implements methods for the bioimage analysis field, with a special emphasis on those developed by the [Henriques Laboratory](https://henriqueslab.github.io/).
It will be distributed as a Python Library and also as [Codeless Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoPyx#codeless-jupyter-notebooks-available), that can be run locally or on Google Colab, and as a [napari plugin](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/napari-NanoPyx).

You can read more about NanoPyx in our [publication].

Currently it implements the following approaches:
- A reimplementation of the NanoJ image registration, SRRF and Super Resolution metrics
- eSRRF
- Non-local means denoising
- More to come soon™
