# plover2CAT

Note: In line with the new Plover 5 release, Plover2CAT is releasing 4.0.0-alpha, which should retain all existing functionalities and is installable on Plover 5 by Github. All issues can be reported here or in Discord.

Plover2CAT is a plugin for Plover, the open-source stenography engine. If the only user requirement is to write steno on the computer, this plugin is not needed as Plover is more than sufficient. Plover2CAT supplements Plover by providing some features of a computer-aided-transcription (CAT) program.

## Features Overview

- a rich text editor with steno hidden underneath:
  - paragraph "block" type formatting
  - undo/redo history
  - conventional editing features such as cut/copy/paste and clipboard
  - find and replace for simple text, steno stroke, and untrans
  - spellcheck using the `spylls` library with user-selectable dictionaries
  - autosave transcripts
  - image insertion
  - navigation of heading paragraphs
  - typing input when Plover is disabled

- steno related features such as:
  - define/delete last untrans
  - define retroactive
  - insertion automatic paragraph affixes based on paragraph style
  - insertion of user defined fields
  - insertion of index entries
  - timestamped paper tape
  - creation and loading of transcript-specific dictionaries for each transcript

- audiovisual synchonization and recording

- captioning features such as:
  - separate window to display captions
  - customizable line lengths and word buffer between current text and text displayed
  - customizable minimum time interval between lines appearing
  - send captions to Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or OBS (both local and remote)

- export transcript formats (with style templates):
  - plain text
  - HTML
  - ASCII
  - SubRip
  - RTF/CRE 
  - OpenDocument Text 

- outline suggestions based on stroke history (powered by [Tapey Tape](https://github.com/rabbitgrowth/plover-tapey-tape) or [clippy_2](https://github.com/Josiah-tan/plover_clippy_2))

- transcript versioning using the `dulwich` library

- custom shortcuts for menu items

- translation of paper tape file into transcript

This plugin is built on Plover and inspired by [plover_cat](https://github.com/LukeSilva/plover_cat). 

New features are generally added over time when requested.
