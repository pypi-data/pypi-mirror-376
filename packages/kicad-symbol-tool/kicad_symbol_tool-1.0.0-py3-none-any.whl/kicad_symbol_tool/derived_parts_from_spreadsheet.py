    """
    Generates an Excel spreadsheet from a KiCad symbol library, organizing derived symbols by their template.
    For each template symbol (identified by names starting with '~'), this function creates a separate sheet in the
    output Excel file. Each sheet contains a list of all symbols derived from that template, with their parameter
    values as columns. The first column in each sheet is always "Symbol Name".

    If the output Excel file already exists, the function will overwrite sheets corresponding to each template.
    Otherwise, it creates a new Excel file.

    Args:
        library_path (Path): Path to the KiCad symbol library file.
        output_path (Path): Path to the output Excel spreadsheet file.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified library file does not exist.
        AssertionError: If the symbol file cannot be parsed, is not a valid KiCad symbol library.
        KiCadVersionError: If the KiCad version is unsupported.
        KeyError: If a requested symbol or template does not exist.
        ValueError: If attempting to create a symbol with a duplicate name or invalid section/mode.
        sexpdata.ExpectClosingBracket, sexpdata.ExpectNothing, sexpdata.ExpectSExp: There was an error
