    This module provides the `KiCadSymbolLibrary` class and related utilities for reading, manipulating, and writing KiCad 
    symbol library files in S-expression format. It enables parsing symbol files, extracting and modifying symbol properties, 
    managing symbol inheritance, and generating new derived symbols. The module also handles version checking and supports 
    writing updated symbol libraries back to disk.

    Classes:
        KiCadSymbolLibrary: Represents a KiCad symbol library file and provides methods for symbol management.
        KiCadVersionError: Exception raised for KiCad version-related errors.

    Functions:
        get_project_version(pyproject_path: Path) -> str:
            Reads the project version from a pyproject.toml file.

    Constants:
        _valid_kicad_symbol_sections: List of valid section names within a symbol.

    Typical usage example:
        library = KiCadSymbolLibrary(Path("my_symbols.kicad_sym"))
        properties = library.get_symbol_properties("R_0805")
        library.modify_properties("R_0805", {"Value": "10k"})
        library.write_library(Path("my_symbols_modified.kicad_sym"))

    KiCadSymbolLibrary(symbol_file: Path, sexp: list | None = None)
    Represents a KiCad symbol library file, providing methods to read, parse, manipulate, and write
    the symbol definitions in the KiCad S-expression format.

    This class allows you to:
    - Load and parse a KiCad symbol library file or a pre-parsed S-expression.
    - Access and modify symbol properties.
    - Derive new symbols from templates.
    - Delete symbols from the library.
    - Write the modified library back to disk.

        file (Path): Path to the KiCad symbol library file.
        _symbol_sexpr (list): Parsed S-expression content of the symbol file.
        _symbols (dict[str, list]): Dictionary mapping symbol names to their S-expression data.
        _kicad_version (int | None): Version of the KiCad symbol library format.

    Methods:
        get_kicad_version() -> int:
            Returns the KiCad symbol library version number.
        symbol_derived_from(symbol_name: str) -> str | None:
            Returns the name of the template symbol if the specified symbol is derived from one.
        get_symbol_properties(symbol_name: str) -> dict[str, str] | None:
            Retrieves the properties of a specified symbol as a dictionary.
        delete_symbol(symbol_name: str) -> None:
        get_symbol(symbol_name: str) -> list | None:
            Retrieves a deep copy of the full S-expression for the specified symbol.
        modify_properties(symbol_name: str, new_properties: dict[str, str]) -> None:
            Updates the properties of a specified symbol by replacing existing property values.
