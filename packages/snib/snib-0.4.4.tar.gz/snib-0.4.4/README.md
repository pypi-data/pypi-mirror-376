**Snib** is a Python CLI tool to scan your projects and generate prompt-ready chunks for use with LLMs.

## üí° Why Snib?

Today there are many AI coding assistants such as Copilot, Cursor, and Tabnine. They are powerful but often expensive, tied to specific models, and in some cases not as good at reasoning as other LLMs available on the web.

Snib keeps you flexible:
- Use any LLM - free, paid, reasoning-strong, or lightweight.  
- Use your favorite model‚Äôs web UI while snib prepares your code for input.

## üöÄ Features

- Recursively scan projects with include/exclude rules.
- Generate prompt-ready chunks with configurable sizes.
- Section formatting and built-in tasks to guide the AI.
- Simple CLI with three commands: `init`, `scan`, and `clean`.

## üì¶ Installation 

```bash
pip install snib
```
