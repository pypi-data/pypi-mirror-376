Subject: [PATCH] doc/CMakeLists.txt: remove useless cmake_minimum_required()

There's already one in top CMakeLists.txt (at 3.9.0 currently)

Newer CMake versions throw this warning with current 3.2.0:
```
CMake Deprecation Warning at doc/CMakeLists.txt:27 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.
  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.
```
