This module allows you to change the analytical account in the timesheet,
regardless of whether it has already been validated, invoiced, or is pending,
when the linked task changes accounts (as happens with an item in a sales order).

In addition, when you change the analytical account for a project,
it is also automatically updated in all its tasks.
