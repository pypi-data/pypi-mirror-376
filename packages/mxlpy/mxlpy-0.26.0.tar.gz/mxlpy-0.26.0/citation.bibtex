	abstract = {Summary: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have accelerated the adoption of ML in biology, enabling powerful predictive models across diverse applications. However, in scientific research, the need for interpretability and mechanistic insight remains crucial. To address this, we introduce MxlPy, a Python package that combines mechanistic modelling with ML to deliver explainable, data-informed solutions. MxlPy facilitates mechanistic learning, an emerging approach that integrates the transparency of mathematical models with the flexibility of data-driven methods. By streamlining tasks such as data integration, model formulation, output analysis, and surrogate modelling, MxlPy enhances the modelling experience without sacrificing interpretability. Designed for both computational biologists and interdisciplinary researchers, it supports the development of accurate, efficient, and explainable models, making it a valuable tool for advancing bioinformatics, systems biology, and biomedical research.
