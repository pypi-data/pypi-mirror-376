    BufferedReport class handles the storage of report entries in memory.

    This class extends Report and serves as an abstract base class (ABC) to
    manage buffered reporting functionality. It maintains a list of entries
    in memory, allowing them to be added via the `write` method. The entries
    can later be processed or stored persistently when the `close` method
    (to be implemented by subclasses) is called.
