class ImportDependency[F: ProjectFile](Item):
    """
    Represents an import dependency between a dependant and dependency source.

    This class models the relationship of a `dependant` with a `dependency_source`,
    including all artifacts imported from the dependency source. It provides
    capabilities for extracting metadata about the dependency relationship,
    such as unique identifiers, imported artifacts, their respective weights, and
    categories. Additionally, it offers serialization utilities for downstream
    consumption.

    Attributes:
        _dependant (F): The dependant consuming the dependency source.
        _dependency_source (str): The source of the dependency being imported.
        _imported_artifacts (dict[str, str]): A mapping of artifact names to their
            alternate aliases if provided, defaulting to artifact names themselves.

        Initializes an instance of the class, and sets up internal attributes related to
        the dependant object, the source of dependencies, and the mapping of imported
        artifacts.

        Args:
            dependant: Callable or function serving as the dependant, which can include
                logic that relies on external dependencies.
            dependency_source: String representing the source or context of dependencies,
                e.g., a file path, module, or other source identifier.
            imported_artifacts: Dictionary mapping the names of imported artifacts (keys)
                to their aliases (values). If no alias is specified, the artifact name is
                used as the alias.

        Attributes:
            _dependant: Stores the dependant function or callable provided during
                initialization.
            _dependency_source: Stores a string identifier for the source of dependencies.
            _imported_artifacts: A dictionary where keys are artifact names and values are
                aliases. If no alias is provided during initialization, the artifact name
                is used as the alias.
