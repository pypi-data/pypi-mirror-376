## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Quantized RoBERTa ONNX model for speed & efficiency
- ✅ Runs fully on CPU (no GPU required)
- ✅ Easy-to-use Python API
- ✅ Hugging Face Hub integration (auto-downloads model + tokenizer)
- ✅ Returns both labels (Positive/Negative/Neutral) and confidence score

## 📝 Usage

```python
from txtemo import predict

print(predict("I love this AI model!"))  
# ('Positive 😃', 0.92)

print(predict("This is the worst thing ever."))  
# ('Negative 😡', 0.89)

print(predict("Pranesh"))  
# ('Neutral 😐', 0.75)
```
