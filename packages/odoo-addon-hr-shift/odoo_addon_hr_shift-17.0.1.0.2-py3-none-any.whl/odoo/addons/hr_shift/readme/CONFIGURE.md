In order to configure and create shift plannings you'll need to be in the *__Shift Manager__*
security group.

## Creating shifts

Go to *Shifts > Shifts* and create a new one. Define a name, a color (it will be used in
the shifts assignment cards), a start and end time, a time zone and week days span.

Create as many as you need to.

## Setting employees with variable shifts.

Go to *Employees > Employees* and in the tab *Work information* go to the *Schedule*
section. There you can set the *__Shift planning__* checkbox if this employee should
have a shift generated automatically in the weekly plannings.

## Setting the default work week

Go to *Settings > Employees* and in the *Work organization* section you can define
the default working week for your company. By default it goes from Monday to Friday.
