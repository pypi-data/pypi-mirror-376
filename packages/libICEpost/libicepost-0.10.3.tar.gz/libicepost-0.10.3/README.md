# libICEpost

Postprocessing of data sampled from internal combustion engines (Experimental, 1D/0D (Gasdyn/GT-Power), 3D (LibICE-OpenFOAM/commercial codes), etc.)

## Installation

### Requirements


#### <img src=https://img.icons8.com/fluent/512/anaconda--v2.png width="13" height="13" /> Conda

It is suggested to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python environment manager to use the library, so that the correct python version can be used in a dedicated environment. **Currently working on python version 3.11.4**.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you install conda (eg. `C:\Users\your_name\anaconda3`), it is suggested to let it initialize conda automatically at the first installation (insert `yes` when it requires). Then, opening a new terminal you should see the `(base)` in front of your user-name in the command line:
> ```bash
> (base) user@machine:/home/user$  
> ```
> Then, you can disable the auto-activation by entering the following line in the new terminal:
> ```bash
> conda config --set auto_activate_base false
> ```
> Now, opening a new terminal you should not see the `(base)` anymore.

Open a new terminal in the folder and execute the following line to install Python 3.11, which is _required_.

```bash
conda install python==3.11
```

You may want to install it in a dedicated environment, to prevent conflicts between packages and python versions. Here is an example to create the dedicated environment `ICE`:

```bash
conda create --name ICE python==3.11
```

Then you can activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate ICE
```

From now, you should see the `(ICE)` entry at the beginning of the command line, showing you are in the python environment `ICE`.

[GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) is necessary to download the repository. Follow the instructions to install the program. No further action are necessary.

### Downloading and installing the source code of LibICE-post

#### Download

In order to download the source code of `LibICE-post` proceed as follows:  
1. Create a new folder in your home directory (`C:\Users\<username>` on Windows OS, `/home/<username>` on Debian) called `LibICE_repo`, where the various libraries will be stored;
2. Now open VS Code and with the `Open Folder` command, under the `File` tab open the folder you just created;
3. You should find yourself in VS Code with the `Explorer` bar on the left that has the name of the folder you created as title.


![screenshot](./docs/imagesForMd/First_Explorer.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Only for Windows user  
> Open `Setting` (shortcut `Ctrl+,`), and input in the search bar:  
> ```bash
> select default profile
> ```
> Dind and select the Command Prompt as **Default Profile**, you should see a similar result as reported here:
>> **Terminal > Integrated > Default Profile: Windows**  
>> The default terminal profile on Windows.  
>> Command Prompt

Now open a new terminal by clicking on `New Terminal` in the `Terminal` menu (`Ctrl+shitf+Ã²` keyboard shortcut on Windows OS). A window on the bottom of VS Code should have appeared.
In the terminal, copy the following command to download `LibICE-post`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamogninoF/LibICE-post.git
```

You should now see in the explorer bar that a new `LIBICE-POST` tab has appeared, like so

![screenshot](./docs/imagesForMd/Second_Explorer.png)

#### Installing `LibICE-post`

Now that `LibICE-post` is downloaded, it is to be installed. First, activate the conda environment where you want to install the libraries (in this example `ICE`).

```
conda activate ICE
```
Then you can install it:
```bash
pip install ./LibICE-post
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may run `pip install` with `-e` option to install in editable mode, so that the changes are detected when pulling from the repository. If you do not include the entry -e, the repository **must be installed again every time you pull changes**, otherwise they are not detected. **This is suggested for users.**
>
> It might happen that spyder or VS Code cannot access the module when installed in editable mode (`ImportError: module libICEpost not found`). If so, install it with `editable_mode=strict` (highly suggested):
> 
> ```bash
> pip install -e ./LibICE-post --config-settings editable_mode=strict
> ```

Follow the instruction on the terminal and you should see the following line as a result.

```bash
Successfully installed libICEpost
```

## Usage

Now that `libICEpost` is installed, you can start to use it. To do so, under [`LibICE-post\tutorials\sparkIgnition`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition) you find a simple case intended to be used as base to understand the usage of this tool. Please duplicate the `sparkIgnition` folder in another location of your choice and the open that folder in VS Code. You should find yourself in this image.

![screenshot](./docs/imagesForMd/Tutorial_1.png)

### Setting the `dictionaries`

In the [`dictionaries`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries) folder you find four different Python scripts that will be used to compose the dictionary used by the post-processing tool. In particular these are:
- [`combustionProperties.py`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries/combustionProperties.py), used to specify the initial mixture of the charge trapped inside the cylinder;
-  [`dataDict.py`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries/dataDict.py), used to determine the pre-processing of the data that will be used in the tool;
- [`thermophysicalProperties.py`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries/thermophysicalProperties.py) used to choose the models to compute the various thermodynamic quantities;
- [`controlDict.py`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries/controlDict.py), acts as wrapper of the previous three files and allows the specification of engine-specific features and the crank angle period of interest to be processed.

The user is highly encouraged to read and understand each of these files as they greatly influence the results of the post-processing.

Additional documentation will be provided in later releases.

### Including the `data`

The [`data`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/data) folder contains the experimental/simulated data that will be imported by the tool to be processed. The minimum requirement is to have a in-cylinder pressure file (in this case the `p.cyl` file). It is not necessary that your data is formatted in the same way as the one in the tutorial case. You can specify the reading of a given format in the `dataDict.py` script. In the proposed case the reading of pressure is performed as follow in `dataDict.py`:

```Python
#Pressure (mandatory)
"p":\ #specify how the variables will be called in runtime
{
    #The format of the data to load
    "format":"file",    #Retrieve from file
    
    #The parameters to use
    "data":
    {
        #Name of the file
        "fileName":"p.Cyl",
        
        #Options to apply (scaling, shifting, etc.)
        "opts":\
            {
                #"delimiter":",",   #Delimiter in file, in this case there was no delimiter !
                # "varScale":1.0,   #Scaling variable
                # "varOff":0.0,     #Offset to variable
                # "CAscale":1.0,    #Scaling CA
                # "CAoff":0.0,      #Offset to CA
            }
    }
},
```

As specified before, the pressure is the only mandatory data needed as import. However, other quantities can and have to specified, such as the mass at IVC, the wall temperatures and others. The user can decide to specify any variable of interest by reading those from files, by considering them constant or by defining a specific function.

### Running the `main.py` script

After having set-up the files in the [`dictionaries`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries) folder and having made sure to include in the [`data`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/data) folder the required quantities, you can open the `main.py` file in which you'll find the main script to postprocess the data.

The `main.py` script is mainly divided of two parts: data processing and post-processing. The former is composed of the loading of the model from the various dictionaries stored in the [`dictionaries`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries)directory, plus the call to the processing of the data.

```python
#Load the model
model = loadModel("./dictionaries/")

#Process the data in the engine model
model.process()
```

The following part of the code is intended to post-process the data that was processed by the tool. Here you can define some specific plots you want to see like a p-V diagram, which is already implemented as part of the `model` class:

```python
#Plotting p-V diagram
ax = model.plotPV(label="CFD", timingsParams={"markersize":120, "linewidth":2})
plt.tight_layout()
```

It is possible to produce user-defined plots with the `model.data.plot()` function, like done here:
```python
#Plotting ROHR vs CA diagram
model.data.plot(x = "CA", y="ROHR", label="CFD", legend=True, c="k", figsize=(10,10))
plt.xlabel("Crank angle [CA]")
plt.ylabel("Rate of heat release [J/deg]")
plt.tight_layout()
```

You can change the `x` and `y` axes as you wish, paying attention that they are defined in the `model.data` structure.

To launch the script use the `Run Python File` command on the upper-right corner.

![screenshot](./docs/imagesForMd/Tutorial_2.png)

A terminal should open and two plots should appear.

From this simple case setup you can explore and expand to run the postprocess you wish. A brief documentation (that will be expanded) is reported in each of the files under the [`dictionaries`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/dictionaries) folder. 

In the [`data`](./tutorials/sparkIgnition/data) folder, the data that has to be processed has to be included.

Additional documentation can be found in [`references`](./docs/references)

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, for Windows user, when reopening VS Code the following orange warning may appear in the terminal tab

![screenshot](./docs/imagesForMd/ErrorRelaunch.png)

If this happens, please click on `Relaunch Terminal` with hovering (not clicking) on `cmd`. The next time you reopen the folder it should not happen again.
