Classes for thermodynamic modeling of a mixture

Content of the package
    mixingRules (package)
        Contains detailed packages and classes for computation 
        of thermodynamic properties and equation of state of mixtures

    ThermoMixture (module)
        Module defining the ThermoMixture class, which completely
        handles the thermodynamic modeling of a mixture of gasses
        NOTE:
            In future it might be convenient to switch to a package structure, 
            in case multiple thermodynamic mixtures are defined (multi-phase?)
