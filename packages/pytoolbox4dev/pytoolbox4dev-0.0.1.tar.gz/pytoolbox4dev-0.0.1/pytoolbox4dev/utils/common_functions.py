def measure_execution_time(func, *args, **kwargs):
    """Measures and prints the execution time of a given function.

    This function acts as a wrapper to time another function's execution.
    It captures the start and end times using `time.perf_counter()` for
    high precision. If the wrapped function raises an exception, it prints
    the elapsed time until the exception and then re-raises it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function to be executed and timed.
    *args
        Variable length argument list to be passed to `func`.
    **kwargs
        Arbitrary keyword arguments to be passed to `func`.

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        The result returned by the executed function `func`.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Re-raises any exception that occurs during the execution of `func`.
