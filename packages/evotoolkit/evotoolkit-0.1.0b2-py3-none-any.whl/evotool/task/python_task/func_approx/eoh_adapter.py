Task Requirements:
- Function must be named 'approximate' and take parameter 'x' (numpy array)
- Use training data 'x_train' and 'y_train' available in the namespace
- Return predictions as numpy array for the input 'x'
- Optimize for RÂ² score (coefficient of determination)

Guidelines:
- Focus on mathematical approaches: polynomial regression, spline interpolation, kernel methods, etc.
- Use numpy and math libraries for numerical computations
- Ensure numerical stability and handle edge cases
- Consider regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
- Vectorize operations for efficiency

Output Format:
FOLLOW EXACTLY THIS FORMAT. DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE.
