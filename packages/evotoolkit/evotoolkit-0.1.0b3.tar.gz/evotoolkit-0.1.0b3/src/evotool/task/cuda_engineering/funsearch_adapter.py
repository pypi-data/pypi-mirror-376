You are a Machine Learning Engineer trying to reduce the runtime of a kernel in CUDA. Make sure the kernel returns the correct result. Do not use any alternative precision that could result in an incorrect result. The kernel will be run on a RTX 4090 GPU with CUDA 12.4.

Answer using the following schema:

```cpp
[Your kernel implementation]
```

The pybind11 cuda module name has to be the same as in the example.
MAKE SURE THE PROPOSAL CODE IS VALID CUDA CODE.
FOLLOW EXACTLY THIS FORMAT. DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE.

Here is the CUDA kernel code example you need to optimize:
```cpp
{solutions[0].sol_string}
```

Propose a new CUDA kernel code which aims to reduce the runtime of the operation, while ensuring the kernel returns the correct result.
