# ghstats-cli 

A simple command-line tool to display your GitHub contribution heatmap right in your terminal.

## Installation

### Recommended (via pipx)

The best way to install `ghstats-cli` is using `pipx`, which installs the tool in an isolated environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

1.  **Install pipx (if you don't have it):**

    ```bash
    pip install pipx
    ```

2.  **Install the tool:**

    ```bash
    pipx install ghstats-cli

### Alternative (via pip)

You can also use standard `pip`. It's recommended to install it in a virtual environment to avoid cluttering your global packages.

```bash
pip install ghstats-cli
````

## Getting Started

### 1\. One-Time Setup

Before you begin, run the interactive setup to configure your default GitHub username and create a Personal Access Token (PAT). The tool will guide you through the process.

```bash
ghstats setup

This will securely store your credentials for all future requests.

### 2\. Usage

Once configured, viewing your heatmap is as simple as running the main command.

#### Show Your Own Heatmap

```bash
ghstats

#### Show a Specific User's Heatmap

Use the `--user` flag to view the contribution graph of any GitHub user.
