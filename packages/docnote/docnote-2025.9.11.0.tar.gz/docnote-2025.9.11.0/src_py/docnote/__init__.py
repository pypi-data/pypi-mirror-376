    "attached" to.

                the same result, the ordering of child members is, by default,
                completely up to the documentation generator's implementation.

                The ordering index can be used to override the default behavior
                and explicitly specify its position within the parent. Values
                function like indices in python: positive values are indexed
                from the start of the siblings list, negative values from the
                end, with the default, unordered siblings in-between.

                Ordering indices need not be sequential. All of the following
                would be valid, and must be sorted as shown:

                > Non-sequential indices
                __embed__: 'code/python'

                If two siblings have the same index, the ordering should be
                stable with respect to the default ordering. In other words,
                they should first be ordered by their indices, and then
                siblings with matching ``ordering_index`` values should be
                ordered by the documentation generator's default ordering
