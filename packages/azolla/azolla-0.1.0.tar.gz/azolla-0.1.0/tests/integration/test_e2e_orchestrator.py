"""
End-to-end integration tests for Python client library with Azolla orchestrator.

These tests validate the complete integration between:
- Python client (task submission)
- Azolla orchestrator (Rust binary)
- Python worker (task execution)

Test scenarios:
1. Task succeeds on first attempt (echo_task)
2. Task succeeds after retries (flaky_task)  
3. Task fails after exhausting all attempts (always_fail_task)
