      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship covered by this License,
      whether in Source or binary form, available under the License,
      whether as a result of original authorship or pursuant to
      which such Work was created. You may add Your own copyright
      statement to Your work and may provide additional or different
      license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
      distribution of Your work or for any such Derivative Works as
      a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of
      the Work otherwise complies in all respects with the terms of
      this License.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this
      License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Support. When redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
      for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
      obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
      accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
      Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
      only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
      harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
      such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
      support.
