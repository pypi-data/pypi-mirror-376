# AbstractToolForge

**A framework to enable Agentic AI to create and update tools when needed, while maintaining reproducibility of actions through versioning.**

## Overview

AbstractToolForge is designed to empower Agentic AI systems with the ability to dynamically create, modify, and manage tools throughout their execution lifecycle. The framework emphasizes reproducibility through comprehensive versioning mechanisms, ensuring that AI-driven tool modifications can be tracked, audited, and replicated.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Dynamic Tool Creation**: Enable AI agents to generate new tools as needed
- **Tool Versioning**: Comprehensive versioning system for tool evolution tracking
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure all tool modifications are reproducible and auditable
- **Agent Integration**: Seamless integration with various Agentic AI frameworks
- **Tool Management**: Lifecycle management for AI-created tools

## Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development - Namespace Reserved** ðŸš§

This package is currently in the early development phase. The primary purpose of this initial release is to reserve the "AbstractToolForge" namespace on PyPI while we develop the core functionality.

## Installation

```bash
pip install AbstractToolForge
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please check back soon for contribution guidelines as we develop the project structure.
