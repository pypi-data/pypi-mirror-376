## 1. Introduction to Machine Learning {#introduction}

### 🤖 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning** is the process of teaching computers to make predictions or decisions by learning patterns from data, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

### 🎯 Types of Machine Learning Problems

```python
import edaflow.ml as ml
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification, make_regression

# 🧠 Educational: Different ML problem types

# 1. CLASSIFICATION: Predicting categories
# Examples: Email spam detection, medical diagnosis, customer churn
X_class, y_class = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_classes=2, random_state=42)
df_classification = pd.DataFrame(X_class, columns=[f'feature_{i}' for i in range(10)])
df_classification['is_spam'] = y_class  # Binary: 0 or 1

print("🎯 CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLE: Email Spam Detection")
print(f"Features: {df_classification.columns[:-1].tolist()}")  
print(f"Target classes: {df_classification['is_spam'].unique()}")
print(f"Class distribution: {df_classification['is_spam'].value_counts().to_dict()}")

# 2. REGRESSION: Predicting continuous values  
# Examples: House prices, stock prices, temperature forecasting
X_reg, y_reg = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=8, noise=0.1, random_state=42)
df_regression = pd.DataFrame(X_reg, columns=[f'feature_{i}' for i in range(8)])
df_regression['house_price'] = y_reg

print("\n📈 REGRESSION EXAMPLE: House Price Prediction")
print(f"Features: {df_regression.columns[:-1].tolist()}")
print(f"Target range: ${df_regression['house_price'].min():,.0f} - ${df_regression['house_price'].max():,.0f}")
print(f"Target distribution: Mean=${df_regression['house_price'].mean():,.0f}, Std=${df_regression['house_price'].std():,.0f}")
```

### 🔍 The ML Mindset: Learning from Data

```python
# 🧠 Educational: Why ML works

# Traditional Programming:
# Input + Program → Output
# Example: Calculate tax = income * tax_rate

# Machine Learning:
# Input + Output → Program (Model)
# Example: Give me 1000s of examples of (income, actual_tax_paid)
# ML learns the tax calculation rules automatically!

# ✅ Let's see this in action with edaflow.ml
experiment = ml.setup_ml_experiment(df_classification, target_column='is_spam')

print("🧪 ML Experiment Setup:")
print(f"Training samples: {len(experiment['X_train'])}")
print(f"Validation samples: {len(experiment['X_val'])}")  
print(f"Test samples: {len(experiment['X_test'])}")
print(f"Features: {len(experiment['feature_names'])}")
print(f"Problem type: {experiment['problem_type']}")
```

## 2. Problem Definition and Data Preparation {#problem-definition}

### 🎯 Defining Your ML Problem

Before choosing algorithms, you must clearly define your problem:

```python
# 🧠 Educational: Problem definition framework

def define_ml_problem(description):
    """
    Framework for defining ML problems clearly
    """
    print("🎯 ML PROBLEM DEFINITION FRAMEWORK")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    questions = [
        "1. What exactly are you trying to predict?",
        "2. What type of prediction is this? (classification/regression)", 
        "3. What data do you have available?",
        "4. How will success be measured?",
        "5. What are the business constraints?",
        "6. How will the model be used in practice?"
    ]
    
    for question in questions:
        print(f"❓ {question}")
    
    return questions

# Example problem definitions:
problems = {
    "Customer Churn": {
        "prediction": "Will a customer cancel their subscription next month?",
        "type": "Binary Classification", 
        "success_metric": "Reduce churn rate by 15%",
        "business_constraint": "Must identify at-risk customers 2 weeks in advance",
        "model_usage": "Weekly batch predictions to trigger retention campaigns"
    },
    
    "House Price Estimation": {
        "prediction": "What should this house be priced at?",

        "business_constraint": "Must work for houses in 5 different cities",
        "model_usage": "Real-time pricing for real estate website"
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Data Validation and Splitting

```python
# ✅ Use edaflow.ml for professional data validation
experiment = ml.setup_ml_experiment(
    df_classification, 
    target_column='is_spam',
    test_size=0.2,        # Hold out 20% for final testing
    validation_size=0.2,  # Use 20% of training for validation
    random_state=42,      # Reproducibility  
    stratify=True,        # Keep class proportions
    verbose=True
)

# 🧠 Educational: Why this splitting strategy?

print("""
📊 DATA SPLITTING STRATEGY:

🎯 TRAIN SET (64%): Learn patterns
   - Used to fit model parameters
   - Model sees this data during training
   - Should represent the real-world distribution

🔍 VALIDATION SET (16%): Tune hyperparameters  
   - Used to evaluate different model configurations
   - Helps prevent overfitting to training data
   - Used for model selection and hyperparameter tuning

🧪 TEST SET (20%): Final performance estimate
   - NEVER used during training or tuning
   - Simulates real-world performance
   - Only used once for final evaluation

⚠️ STRATIFICATION: Keeps class proportions consistent
   - Important for imbalanced datasets
   - Ensures each split represents the population
   - Required for reliable performance estimates

# Validate data quality - ⭐ Enhanced with dual API support
# Pattern 1: Using experiment config (recommended)
validation_report = ml.validate_ml_data(experiment, verbose=True)

# Pattern 2: Direct X, y usage (sklearn-style) - also supported!
# validation_report = ml.validate_ml_data(
#     X=experiment['X_train'],
#     y=experiment['y_train'],

## 3. Algorithm Selection and Understanding {#algorithms}

### 🧠 How Different Algorithms Think

Each ML algorithm makes different assumptions about your data:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

### 🔬 Algorithm Comparison in Practice

```python
# ✅ Compare algorithms with edaflow.ml
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(random_state=42),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    'SVM': SVC(probability=True, random_state=42),

print("🏆 Model Comparison Results:")
print(comparison)

# 🧠 Educational: Understanding the results
print("""
📊 INTERPRETING COMPARISON RESULTS:

🎯 ACCURACY: Overall correctness (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)
   - Good general metric but can be misleading with imbalanced data
   - Example: 90% accuracy on 90% majority class = not impressive

🎯 PRECISION: Of positive predictions, how many were correct TP/(TP+FP)  
   - Important when false positives are costly
   - Example: Medical diagnosis - don't want healthy people getting unnecessary treatment

🎯 RECALL (SENSITIVITY): Of actual positives, how many did we find TP/(TP+FN)
   - Important when false negatives are costly  
   - Example: Fraud detection - don't want to miss actual fraud

🎯 F1-SCORE: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
   - Good balance metric when you care about both precision and recall
   - Useful for imbalanced datasets

🎯 ROC-AUC: Area Under ROC Curve
   - Measures ability to distinguish between classes at all thresholds
   - 0.5 = random guessing, 1.0 = perfect separation

## 4. Model Training and Cross-Validation {#training}

### 🔄 Understanding Cross-Validation

**Cross-validation** is the gold standard for estimating how well your model will perform on unseen data:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold

# 🧠 Educational: Why cross-validation matters

print("""
🔄 CROSS-VALIDATION EXPLAINED:

❌ NAIVE APPROACH: Train on all data, hope for the best
   - No way to estimate real-world performance
   - High risk of overfitting
   - False confidence in model quality

✅ CROSS-VALIDATION: Multiple train/validation splits
   - More reliable performance estimate
   - Reduces variance in performance estimates
   - Helps detect overfitting
   - Uses all data for both training and validation

## 5. Hyperparameter Optimization {#hyperparameters}

### 🎛️ Understanding Hyperparameters

**Hyperparameters** are the knobs you can turn to control how your model learns:

```python
# 🧠 Educational: Hyperparameter impact demonstration

        'what_it_controls': "Minimum samples required to split a node",
        'low_values': "More splits, complex model, may overfit", 
        'high_values': "Fewer splits, simpler model, may underfit",
        'typical_range': "2-20"

🔧 FEATURE ENGINEERING BEST PRACTICES:

1. DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:
   - Use business understanding to create meaningful features
   - Example: In e-commerce, create "days_since_last_purchase"

2. INTERACTION FEATURES:  
   - Multiply or combine features that might work together
   - Example: price × quantity = total_value

3. POLYNOMIAL FEATURES:
   - Add squared, cubed terms for non-linear relationships
   - Be careful of curse of dimensionality

4. TIME-BASED FEATURES:
   - Extract hour, day, month from timestamps  
   - Create recency features (days_since_X)

5. AGGREGATION FEATURES:
   - Group by categorical features and compute statistics
   - Example: average purchase amount by customer segment

6. TEXT FEATURES:
   - Length, word count, sentiment scores
   - TF-IDF, word embeddings

⚠️ WARNING: More features ≠ Better performance
   - Can lead to overfitting
   - Increases computation and storage costs
   - Use feature selection techniques
