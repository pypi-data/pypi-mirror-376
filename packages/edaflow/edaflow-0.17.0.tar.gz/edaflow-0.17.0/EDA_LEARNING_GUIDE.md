## 1. Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis {#introduction}

### 🤔 What is EDA?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the critical first step in any data science project. It's the process of analyzing and investigating data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

### 🎯 Why is EDA Important?

```python
# Without EDA, you might miss critical insights like this:
import edaflow
import pandas as pd

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# ❌ Jumping straight to modeling without EDA
# model.fit(df.drop('sales', axis=1), df['sales'])  # This could fail!

# ✅ Start with EDA to understand your data
edaflow.check_null_columns(df)
# Discovers: 40% missing values in 'customer_age' column!

edaflow.analyze_categorical_columns(df)
# Discovers: 'product_code' has 500+ unique values stored as text!

edaflow.visualize_histograms(df)
# Discovers: 'sales' has extreme outliers affecting model performance!
```

### 🔍 The EDA Mindset

EDA is like being a **data detective**. You're looking for:
- **Data Quality Issues**: Missing values, incorrect data types, duplicates
- **Patterns and Trends**: What story does your data tell?
- **Relationships**: How do variables interact with each other?
- **Anomalies**: What doesn't fit the expected pattern?
- **Assumptions**: Can you use certain statistical methods?

---

## 2. Data Quality Assessment {#data-quality}

### 📊 Understanding Missing Data

**Missing data** is one of the most common data quality issues. But not all missing data is the same!

#### Types of Missing Data:
1. **MCAR (Missing Completely At Random)**: Missing values are random
2. **MAR (Missing At Random)**: Missing depends on observed data
3. **MNAR (Missing Not At Random)**: Missing depends on unobserved data

```python
import edaflow
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset with missing values
df = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# 🔍 Step 1: Identify missing data patterns
missing_analysis = edaflow.check_null_columns(df, threshold=5)

# What edaflow tells you:
# - Which columns have missing values
# - Percentage of missing data per column
# - Color-coded severity levels
# - Recommendations for handling missing data

# 🧠 Educational Insight:
# - Green (< 5%): Usually safe to drop or impute
# - Yellow (5-30%): Investigate patterns before deciding
# - Red (> 30%): Major issue, might need domain expertise
```

#### 🔬 Deep Dive: Why Missing Data Matters

```python
# Example: The impact of missing data on analysis
import numpy as np

# Simulate customer satisfaction survey data
np.random.seed(42)
satisfied_customers = np.random.normal(85, 10, 1000)  # Happy customers respond more
unsatisfied_customers = np.random.normal(40, 15, 200)  # Unhappy customers respond less

# Missing data creates bias!
# If unsatisfied customers don't respond, you'll overestimate satisfaction

# ✅ Use edaflow to identify this bias
df_survey = pd.DataFrame({
    'satisfaction_score': np.concatenate([satisfied_customers, unsatisfied_customers]),
    'response_time': np.random.exponential(2, 1200),
    'customer_segment': np.random.choice(['Premium', 'Standard', 'Basic'], 1200)
})

# Add realistic missing data patterns
df_survey.loc[df_survey['satisfaction_score'] < 50, 'satisfaction_score'] = np.nan

# Analyze the pattern
edaflow.check_null_columns(df_survey)
edaflow.visualize_histograms(df_survey)
# This reveals the bias in your data!
```

### 🏷️ Data Type Analysis

**Data types** tell you how Python/pandas interprets your data, but they might not reflect the **conceptual type**.

```python
# 🔍 Step 2: Analyze data types and categorical columns
edaflow.analyze_categorical_columns(df, threshold=20)

# What you learn:
# - Columns stored as 'object' that could be numeric
# - High-cardinality categorical variables
# - Potential data entry errors
# - Memory optimization opportunities

# 🧠 Educational Insight:
# Conceptual Types vs Storage Types:
# - ID numbers: Stored as int, but conceptually categorical
# - Zip codes: Stored as int, but conceptually categorical
# - Ratings: Stored as object ("5 stars"), but conceptually ordinal
# - Dates: Stored as object, but conceptually temporal

# ✅ Smart conversion with edaflow
df_cleaned = edaflow.convert_to_numeric(df, threshold=20)
edaflow.display_column_types(df_cleaned)
```

---

## 3. Understanding Data Distributions {#distributions}

### 📈 Why Distributions Matter

Understanding how your data is **distributed** is crucial because:
1. **Statistical tests** assume certain distributions
2. **Machine learning models** perform differently on different distributions
3. **Outliers** are easier to identify when you understand normal patterns
4. **Transformations** can improve model performance

### 🔍 Distribution Analysis with edaflow

```python
# 🔍 Step 3: Analyze data distributions
edaflow.visualize_histograms(df_cleaned, kde=True, show_normal_curve=True)

# What edaflow shows you:
# - Shape of each distribution (normal, skewed, bimodal)
# - Skewness values and interpretation
# - Comparison with normal distribution
# - Outliers and extreme values
```

#### 📊 Types of Distributions and Their Implications

```python
# 🧠 Educational Examples of Different Distributions

# 1. NORMAL DISTRIBUTION (Bell curve)
# Examples: Height, weight, test scores, measurement errors
normal_data = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)
df_normal = pd.DataFrame({'iq_scores': normal_data})

edaflow.visualize_histograms(df_normal)
# ✅ Good for: Linear regression, t-tests, many statistical methods
# 🎯 edaflow insight: Green indicators show "normal distribution detected"

# 2. SKEWED DISTRIBUTION  
# Examples: Income, house prices, website visit duration
skewed_data = np.random.exponential(2, 1000)
df_skewed = pd.DataFrame({'website_session_duration': skewed_data})

edaflow.visualize_histograms(df_skewed)
# ⚠️ Caution: May need transformation for linear models
# 🎯 edaflow insight: Shows skewness value and suggests transformations

# 3. BIMODAL DISTRIBUTION
# Examples: Customer ages (young adults + seniors), test scores (easy vs hard questions)
bimodal_data = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(25, 5, 500), np.random.normal(65, 8, 500)])
df_bimodal = pd.DataFrame({'customer_age': bimodal_data})

edaflow.visualize_histograms(df_bimodal)
# 🧠 Insight: Might indicate two distinct groups in your data
# 🎯 edaflow helps: Visualizes multiple peaks clearly
```

### 🎨 Box Plots: Understanding Variation and Outliers

```python
# 🔍 Step 4: Analyze variation and outliers
edaflow.visualize_numerical_boxplots(df_cleaned, show_skewness=True)

# 🧠 Educational: How to read a box plot
# - Box: Contains middle 50% of data (IQR)
# - Line in box: Median (50th percentile)
# - Whiskers: Extend to 1.5 * IQR
# - Dots: Outliers beyond whiskers
# - Skewness: How symmetric is the distribution?

# Interactive exploration
edaflow.visualize_interactive_boxplots(df_cleaned)
# Hover to see exact values and statistics!
```

---

## 4. Relationships and Correlations {#relationships}

### 🔗 Understanding Relationships in Data

**Correlation** measures how two variables move together, but it's not the whole story!

#### 📈 Types of Relationships

```python
# 🧠 Educational: Different types of relationships

# 1. LINEAR CORRELATION
# Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.8)
x_linear = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
y_linear = 2 * x_linear + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, 1000)

# 2. NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIP  
# Low correlation but strong relationship!
x_nonlinear = np.linspace(-3, 3, 1000)
y_nonlinear = x_nonlinear**2 + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, 1000)

# 3. NO RELATIONSHIP
# Correlation near 0, no pattern
x_random = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
y_random = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)

df_relationships = pd.DataFrame({
    'linear_x': x_linear, 'linear_y': y_linear,
    'nonlinear_x': x_nonlinear, 'nonlinear_y': y_nonlinear,
    'random_x': x_random, 'random_y': y_random
})

# ✅ Visualize relationships with edaflow
edaflow.visualize_correlation_heatmap(df_relationships)
edaflow.visualize_scatter_matrix(df_relationships, show_regression=True)
```

### 🌡️ Correlation Heatmaps: The Big Picture

```python
# 🔍 Step 5: Understand variable relationships
edaflow.visualize_heatmap(df_cleaned, heatmap_type='correlation')

# 🧠 What different correlation values mean:
# r = +1.0: Perfect positive correlation
# r = +0.7: Strong positive correlation  
# r = +0.3: Moderate positive correlation
# r = 0.0: No linear correlation
# r = -0.3: Moderate negative correlation
# r = -0.7: Strong negative correlation
# r = -1.0: Perfect negative correlation

# 🚨 Important: Correlation ≠ Causation!
# High correlation doesn't mean one causes the other
```

### 🎯 Advanced Relationship Analysis

```python
# Multiple types of heatmaps for different insights
edaflow.visualize_heatmap(df_cleaned, heatmap_type='missing')
# Shows missing data patterns - are missing values related?

edaflow.visualize_heatmap(df_cleaned, heatmap_type='values')  
# Shows actual data values - useful for categorical data

edaflow.visualize_heatmap(df_cleaned, heatmap_type='crosstab', 
                         x_column='category_a', y_column='category_b')
# Shows relationships between categorical variables
```

---

## 5. Feature Analysis and Selection {#features}

### 🎯 Understanding Your Features

Not all features are created equal! Some are more predictive than others.

```python
# 🔍 Step 6: Analyze categorical features in depth
edaflow.visualize_categorical_values(df_cleaned)

# What you learn:
# - Unique values per categorical column
# - Distribution of categories
# - Potential issues (too many categories, imbalanced classes)
# - Encoding complexity estimates

# 🧠 Educational: Feature Types and Their Challenges

# HIGH CARDINALITY FEATURES
# Problem: Too many unique values can cause:
# - Memory issues with one-hot encoding
# - Overfitting in models
# - Sparse data problems

# Example: Product IDs (10,000 unique values)
# Solution: Use target encoding or embedding techniques

# IMBALANCED CATEGORICAL FEATURES  
# Problem: When one category dominates:
# - Model bias toward majority class
# - Poor performance on minority classes
# - Misleading accuracy metrics

# Example: Customer type (95% standard, 5% premium)
# Solution: Resampling, cost-sensitive learning, or stratified sampling
```

### 🔍 Feature Importance Insights

```python
# Create example with predictive features
np.random.seed(42)
n_samples = 1000

# Create target variable
target = np.random.choice([0, 1], n_samples, p=[0.6, 0.4])

# Create features with different relationships to target
df_features = pd.DataFrame({
    'highly_predictive': target + np.random.normal(0, 0.3, n_samples),  # Strong signal
    'moderately_predictive': 0.5 * target + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, n_samples),  # Moderate signal  
    'noise_feature': np.random.normal(0, 1, n_samples),  # No signal
    'categorical_predictive': np.where(target == 1, 
                                     np.random.choice(['A', 'B'], n_samples, p=[0.8, 0.2]),
                                     np.random.choice(['A', 'B'], n_samples, p=[0.3, 0.7])),
    'target': target
})

# ✅ Use edaflow to discover predictive relationships
edaflow.visualize_correlation_heatmap(df_features)
edaflow.visualize_scatter_matrix(df_features, target_column='target')

# 🎯 edaflow helps you identify:
# - Which numerical features correlate with target
# - Which categorical features show different distributions per target class
# - Redundant features (highly correlated with each other)
```

---

## 6. Outlier Detection and Treatment {#outliers}

### 🎯 What Are Outliers?

**Outliers** are data points that differ significantly from other observations. They can be:
1. **Measurement errors** (typos, sensor malfunctions)
2. **Natural extreme values** (genuine but rare events)
3. **Data entry mistakes** (wrong units, decimal places)

### 🔍 Outlier Detection Methods

```python
# 🔍 Step 7: Detect and understand outliers
edaflow.visualize_numerical_boxplots(df_cleaned, show_skewness=True)

# 🧠 Educational: Different outlier detection methods

# 1. IQR METHOD (Interquartile Range)
# Outliers: < Q1 - 1.5*IQR or > Q3 + 1.5*IQR
# - Conservative method
# - Works well for normal distributions
# - May miss outliers in skewed data

# 2. Z-SCORE METHOD  
# Outliers: |z-score| > 3 (or 2.5)
# - Assumes normal distribution
# - Good for detecting extreme values
# - Can be influenced by outliers themselves

# 3. MODIFIED Z-SCORE
# Uses median instead of mean
# - More robust to outliers
# - Better for skewed distributions

# ✅ Apply outlier handling with edaflow
df_no_outliers = edaflow.handle_outliers_median(df_cleaned, method='iqr', verbose=True)

# Compare before and after
edaflow.visualize_numerical_boxplots(df_cleaned, title="Before Outlier Treatment")
edaflow.visualize_numerical_boxplots(df_no_outliers, title="After Outlier Treatment")
```

### 🤔 To Remove or Not to Remove?

```python
# 🧠 Educational: Decision framework for outliers

# Example: Sales data analysis
sales_data = np.random.exponential(1000, 1000)  # Most sales are small
sales_data = np.append(sales_data, [50000, 75000, 100000])  # Add some big sales

df_sales = pd.DataFrame({'daily_sales': sales_data})

edaflow.visualize_numerical_boxplots(df_sales)
edaflow.visualize_histograms(df_sales)

# 🎯 Questions to ask:
# 1. Are these outliers errors or genuine observations?
#    - Check data collection process
#    - Validate with domain experts
#    - Look for patterns in outliers

# 2. How do outliers affect your analysis goal?
#    - For average sales: outliers inflate the mean
#    - For forecasting: outliers might be important events
#    - For classification: outliers might be fraud cases

# 3. What's the business context?
#    - Medical data: outliers might be critical cases
#    - Financial data: outliers might be fraud or special events
#    - Survey data: outliers might indicate data quality issues
```

## 7. Data Preprocessing for ML {#preprocessing}

### 🤖 Preparing Data for Machine Learning

After EDA, you understand your data. Now you need to **prepare it for machine learning models**.

```python
# 🔍 Step 8: Analyze encoding needs for ML
encoding_analysis = edaflow.analyze_encoding_needs(
    df_no_outliers,
    target_column='target',  # If you have one
    max_cardinality_onehot=10,
    max_cardinality_target=100
)

# 🧠 Educational: Different encoding strategies

# 1. ONE-HOT ENCODING
# Best for: Low cardinality categorical variables (< 10 categories)
# Creates: One binary column per category
# Example: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green'] → [Red_0/1, Blue_0/1, Green_0/1]

# 2. TARGET ENCODING  
# Best for: High cardinality with target correlation
# Creates: Numerical values based on target statistics
# Example: City → Average target value for that city

# 3. ORDINAL ENCODING
# Best for: Naturally ordered categories
# Creates: Integer values preserving order
# Example: ['Small', 'Medium', 'Large'] → [0, 1, 2]

# 4. BINARY ENCODING
# Best for: Medium cardinality (10-50 categories)
# Creates: Binary representation
# More efficient than one-hot for many categories

# ✅ Apply smart encoding
df_encoded = edaflow.apply_encoding(df_no_outliers, encoding_analysis)

print(f"Original shape: {df_no_outliers.shape}")
print(f"Encoded shape: {df_encoded.shape}")
```

### 🎯 The Complete Preprocessing Pipeline

```python
# 🔍 Step 9: Handle missing values strategically
# For numerical columns: use median (robust to outliers)
df_imputed_num = edaflow.impute_numerical_median(df_encoded)

# For categorical columns: use mode (most frequent)
df_fully_processed = edaflow.impute_categorical_mode(df_imputed_num)

# 🧠 Educational: Why these choices?
# MEDIAN vs MEAN for numerical:
# - Median: Not affected by outliers, robust
# - Mean: Affected by outliers, but preserves total sum

# MODE vs FORWARD-FILL for categorical:
# - Mode: Most likely value based on data
# - Forward-fill: Assumes temporal ordering (often wrong)
```
