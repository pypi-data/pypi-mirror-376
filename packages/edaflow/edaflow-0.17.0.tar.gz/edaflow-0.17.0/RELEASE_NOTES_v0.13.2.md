# edaflow v0.13.2 Release Notes

*Released: August 12, 2025*

## Overview

Version 0.13.2 focuses on enhancing the visual presentation and user experience of edaflow's data analysis outputs. This release introduces refined Rich console styling optimizations across all major EDA functions.

## What's Enhanced

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Display Improvements

**Enhanced Rich Console Styling**
- Optimized panel borders with consistent rounded styling
- Improved width constraints for better alignment across environments
- Refined color schemes and visual hierarchy

**Google Colab Optimization**
- Enhanced console width constraints specifically for notebook environments
- Improved panel rendering for better readability in Google Colab
- Optimized terminal forcing for consistent display

**Professional Presentation**
- Consistent padding and spacing across all EDA functions
- Unified visual standards for data health overviews
- Better alignment and formatting in all output displays

### ðŸ”§ Functions Enhanced

The following core EDA functions received visual enhancements:
- `check_null_columns` - Data health overview displays
- `summarize_eda_insights` - Comprehensive insights presentation  
- `analyze_categorical_columns` - Categorical analysis outputs
- `display_column_types` - Column classification displays
- `convert_to_numeric` - Data conversion summaries
- `impute_numerical_median` - Imputation results presentation

## Technical Details

- **Console Optimization**: All Rich console instances now use `Console(width=80, force_terminal=True)` for consistent rendering
- **Panel Styling**: Upgraded from `box.SIMPLE` and `box.DOUBLE_EDGE` to `box.ROUNDED` for smoother borders
- **Width Constraints**: Applied `width=80` and `padding=(0, 1)` constraints for optimal display alignment
- **Environment Compatibility**: Enhanced rendering across Jupyter, Google Colab, VS Code, and terminal environments

## Backward Compatibility

This release maintains full backward compatibility. All existing functionality remains unchanged - only visual presentation has been enhanced.

## Getting Started

Update to v0.13.2:
```bash
pip install --upgrade edaflow
```

All existing code will continue to work exactly as before, but with improved visual presentation.
