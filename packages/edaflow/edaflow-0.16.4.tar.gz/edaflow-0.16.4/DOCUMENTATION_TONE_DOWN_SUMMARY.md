# Documentation Tone-Down - Remove Overselling Language

## Issue
Previous documentation contained overselling language (rocket emojis, "perfect", "amazing", etc.) that created unrealistic expectations and disappointed users when features didn't work as promised.

## Changes Made

### 1. edaflow/display.py
**Before:**
- "perfect visibility in any theme"
- "🚀 All edaflow functions now display perfectly!"

**After:**
- "better visibility across different themes"
- "📝 edaflow functions should now display with improved visibility"

### 2. README.md
**Before:**
- "🚀 Major ML Expansion"
- "Perfect visibility everywhere!"
- "Works perfectly!"

**After:**  
- "ML Expansion"
- "Improved visibility everywhere!"
- "Should work well!"

### 3. CHANGELOG.md
**Before:**
- "Major ML Expansion 🚀"
- "🚀 NEW CLEAN APIs"
- "perfect dark/light mode visibility"

**After:**
- "ML Expansion"
- "NEW CLEAN APIs" 
- "improved dark/light mode visibility"

## Principles Applied

1. **Factual Language**: Use "improved", "better", "enhanced" instead of "perfect", "amazing"
2. **Realistic Expectations**: "should work well" instead of "works perfectly"
3. **Remove Excessive Emojis**: Especially rocket emojis (🚀) that imply perfection
4. **Honest Promises**: Set appropriate user expectations

## Impact

- More realistic user expectations
- Better trust through honest communication
- Reduced disappointment when features have limitations
- Professional, factual tone throughout documentation

**Documentation Philosophy**: 
Under-promise and over-deliver, rather than over-promise and under-deliver.
