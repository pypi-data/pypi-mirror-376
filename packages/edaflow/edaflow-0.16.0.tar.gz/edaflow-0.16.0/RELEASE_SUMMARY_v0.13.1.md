## Technical Details

### Enhanced Theme Detection
```python
def _detect_colab_theme() -> str:
    # Check environment variables first
    theme_hint = os.environ.get('COLAB_THEME', '').lower()
    if theme_hint in ['dark', 'light']:
        return theme_hint
    
    # JavaScript detection attempts...
    # System preference checking...
    
    return 'auto'  # Smart fallback
```

### Dynamic CSS Implementation
- Added CSS variables for theme adaptation
- Media query support: `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark/light)`
