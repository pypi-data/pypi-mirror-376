# Tumult Analytics â€” an OpenDP project

Tumult Analytics is a Python library to execute differentially private
operations on data, with a strong emphasis on usability and scalability. It is
built atop the [Tumult Core library](https://github.com/opendp/tumult-core).

It was originally developed by
[Tumult Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tmltlabs), and joined the
[OpenDP project](https://opendp.org) after the Tumult Labs team joined LinkedIn.
