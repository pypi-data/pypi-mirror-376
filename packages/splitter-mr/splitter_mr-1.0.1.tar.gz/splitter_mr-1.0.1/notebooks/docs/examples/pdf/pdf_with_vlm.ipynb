    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Although all three methods can read files from various sources, they differ significantly in how VLM analysis is implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`VanillaReader`** extracts graphical files from the input and uses a VLM to provide descriptions for these resources. Currently, it is only compatible with PDFs, and the VLM analysis and PDF reading logic are separated. It is the most scalable method for reading files, as it performs a call for every graphical resource in your PDF. However, this can become expensive for documents with a large number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`MarkItDownReader`** can only transform images into Markdown descriptions. Supported image formats include `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `svg`. It cannot provide hybrid methods for reading PDFs with image annotations. While it is fast and cost-effective, it can only process one file at a time and is limited to OpenAI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`DoclingReader`** can read any file you provide using VLMs. If given a PDF, it reads the entire document with the VLM; the same applies to images and other graphical resources. However, it does not distinguish between text and image content, as the analysis is multimodal. As a result, in some cases, it cannot provide specific descriptions for images but instead analyzes the whole document.\n",

    "Using one or another method depends on your needs!\n",
