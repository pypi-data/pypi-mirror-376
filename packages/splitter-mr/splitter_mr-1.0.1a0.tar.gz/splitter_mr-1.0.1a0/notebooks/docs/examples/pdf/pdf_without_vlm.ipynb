      "\n",
      "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that supports basic formatting -such as headings, bold, italics, links, images, and lists. However, it does not support all the visual and layout options available in PDF, such as columns, custom fonts, footnotes, floating images, and complex tables. Deciding how (or whether) to preserve these elements can be difficult, and often requires tradeoffs between fidelity and simplicity.\n",

      "## 4. Table and Image Extraction\n",
      "\n",
      "Tables and images in PDFs present a particular challenge. Tables are often visually represented using lines and spacing, with no underlying indication that a group of text blocks is actually a table. Extracting these and converting them to Markdown tables (which have a much simpler syntax) is error-prone. Similarly, extracting images from a PDF and re-inserting them in a way that makes sense in Markdown requires careful handling.\n",

      "## 5. Multicolumn Layouts and Flowing Text\n",
      "\n",
      "Many PDFs use complex layouts with multiple columns, headers, footers, or sidebars. Converting these layouts to a single-flowing Markdown document requires decisions about reading order and content hierarchy. It's easy to end up with text in the wrong order or to lose important contextual information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Encoding and Character Set Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "PDFs can use a variety of text encodings, embedded fonts, and even contain nonstandard Unicode characters. Extracting text reliably without corruption or data loss is not always straightforward, especially for documents with special symbols or non-Latin scripts.\n",

      "\n",
      "While it may seem simple on the surface, converting PDFs to formats like Markdown involves a series of technical and interpretive challenges. Effective conversion tools must blend text extraction, document analysis, and sometimes machine learning techniques (such as OCR or structure recognition) to produce usable, readable, and faithful Markdown output. As a result, perfect conversion is rarely possible, and manual review and cleanup are often required.\n",

We can see that headers, tables and lists are markdown formatted, despite bold or italics are not showing. In addition, formulas (`<!-- formula-not-decoded -->`) and images (`<!-- Image -->`) are detected too, despite no description or rendering is provided. Sometimes the line spacing is inconsistent as it was in MarkItDown. However, in general terms, it could be said that it is the method that best formats Markdown.\n",
