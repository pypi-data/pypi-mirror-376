# v1.0.x

> **Version 1.0.0: First stable release with full Reader, Splitter, Embedding and Vision model support.**

## v1.0.1

Add KeywordSplitter to split by regex patterns or specific keywords.

## v1.0.0

First stable version.

### Features

- Consolidated all features introduced in v0.x series into a stable API.
- **Readers**: `VanillaReader`, `MarkItDownReader`, `DoclingReader` with support for multiple formats (text, Office, JSON/YAML, images, HTML, etc.).
- **Splitters**: character, word, sentence, paragraph, recursive, token, paged, row/column, JSON, semantic, HTML tag, header, and code splitting strategies.
- **Models**: support for multimodal Vision-Language Models (OpenAI, Azure, Grok, HuggingFace, Gemini, Claude).
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI, Azure, HuggingFace, Gemini, Claude (via Voyage) supported.

### Developer features

- **Optional extras system**: install lightweight **core** by default, extend with `markitdown`, `docling`, `multimodal`, `azure`, or `all`.
- **CI/CD pipeline**, **PyPI** release, and **pre-commit** checks in place.

### Documentation

**Extensive documentation** with API reference, examples, and architecture diagrams.

### New improvements + Bug fixes

- **Fix:** NLTK tokenizers in `TokenSplitter` are now correct base tokenizer when using `nltk` tokenizers.
- **Fix:** RecursiveJSONSplitter could not produce outputs since it did not validate correct data type.
- Now the examples are based on real Jupyter Notebooks executions to ensure that the behavior is the expected one.
- Added the Notebooks which are used as examples in the `notebooks` section.
- Update `clean` instruction with `poe`.
- New constans have been defined.
- Add new class to transform HTML to Markdown.

# v0.6.x

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Breaking Change! Version v0.6.0**
>
> Dependencies are now split into **core** (installed by default) and **optional extras** for heavy or specialized features.
> - Example: to use MarkItDown and Docling readers, install with:
>   ```bash
>   pip install "splitter-mr[markitdown,docling]"
>   ```
> - To install *all* optional features:
>   ```bash
>   pip install "splitter-mr[all]"
>   ```

> - This change reduces install time and keeps core installs lightweight.

## v0.6.5

**Hotfix**: dependency isolation was not guaranteed.

### Features

- Add a util class to convert HTML to Markdown content.
- Improve Header Splitter to always return its content in markdown format.
- Add the option to return text in markdown format for HTMLTagSplitter.
- Add the option to batch content when using HTMLTagSplitter: If `batch=True`, it returns the chunks grouped by tags up to the numbers of characters specified by `chunk_size`. If False, it will return one register per tag.

### Bug fixes

- Dependency isolation was not guaranteed: implement safe lazy imports in all the `__init__` methods.
- Raise test coverage up to 90%.

> pip install "splitter-mr[multimodal]"
> ```

### Features
