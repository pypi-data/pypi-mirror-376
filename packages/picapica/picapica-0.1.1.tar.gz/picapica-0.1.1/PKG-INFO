# Pica: Persistent key-value storage

## Overview

_Pica pica_: The Eurasian magpie. Known for collecting shiny things 

The `pica` package is very similar to `shelve`, but uses SQLite behinds the scenes instead of DBM. This means that key-value pairs can be edited without the file size increasing, eliminating bloat.

Installation: `pip install picapica`

## Usage

Basic usage:

```python
import pica

with pica.open("data.sqlite") as db:
    db["x"] = 1
    db["y"] = {"a": 42}

    print(db["x"])
    print("y" in db)
    print(len(db))

```

Unlike `shelve`, repeatedly updating key-value pairs does not necessarily increase the file size. However, the storage can still be optimised now and again! For this, use `db.vacuum`:

```python
with pica.open("data.sqlite") as db:
  db.vacuum()
```
