# Nonsense Calculator

**Nonsense** is a quirky command-line calculator that handles basic arithmetic, parentheses, exponentiation, and supports the `ans` keyword to reuse the last result. It's designed for fun and simplicity, perfect for quick calculations in the terminal.

## Features

- Handles `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**/^` with correct operator precedence
- Supports floats and multi-digit numbers
- Parentheses supported: e.g., `(2+3)*4`
- Reuse the last answer with `ans`
- Colorful terminal output if `colorama` is installed

## Installation

```bash
pip install nonsense
