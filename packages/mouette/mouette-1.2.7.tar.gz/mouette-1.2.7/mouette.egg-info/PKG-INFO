Mouette is a small python library for handling point clouds, polylines, surface and volume meshes. It also contains various geometry processing algorithm, like shortest-paths, old-school parametrization or frame field computations.

Mouette (French for seagull) stands for _Maillages, OUtils Et Traitement auTomatique de la géométriE_ (French for "Meshes, Tools and Geometry Processing").

## Installation

Using pip: 
```pip install mouette```

## Overview

Mouette allows to easily load data from various file format and access geometrical primitives

#### Import and export made simple

```python
import mouette as M

mesh = M.mesh.load("path/to/my/mesh/mesh.obj")
print(mesh.vertices[0])
print(mesh.faces[2])
M.mesh.save(mesh,"path/to/export/mesh.obj")
```

#### Define quantities over meshes and work with it

It is possible to define any quantity on mesh elements

```python
my_v_attribute = mesh.vertices.create_attribute("my_attribute", float) # an attribute storing one floating-point number per vertex
my_v_attribute[3] = 4.

my_f_attribute = mesh.faces.create_attribute("my_attribute", 2, int) # an attribute storing two integers per face
m_f_attribute[2] = [1,3]
```

Attributes can store booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and strings, using the provided python types `bool`, `int`, `float`, `complex` and `str`.

#### Call geometry processing algorithms

```python

ff = framefield.SurfaceFrameField(mesh, "vertices", order=4, verbose=True)
ff.run()
ffmesh = ff.export_as_mesh()
M.mesh.save(ffmesh, "framefield.mesh")
```

#### And much more
