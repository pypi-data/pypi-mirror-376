Overview
********

**MPSPlots** is a personal plotting library developed as a streamlined wrapper around two popular visualization tools: **Matplotlib** for 2D plotting and **PyVista** for 3D visualization.
This library was created with the goal of balancing ease-of-use with flexibility, allowing users to produce consistent plots for scientific publications.
Initially developed to standardize the author’s scientific plots, **MPSPlots** continues to evolve, providing a customizable yet simple interface for a wide range of plotting needs.

Key Features:
- Intuitive and straightforward API, abstracting common plotting tasks.
- High-quality outputs tailored for scientific journals.
- Seamless integration with Matplotlib and PyVista.
- Easily customizable plots without sacrificing flexibility.

The motivation behind this library was to make complex plotting routines more accessible while maintaining the ability to fine-tune results as needed, making it ideal for researchers and scientists who require consistent, publication-ready plots.

----

Installation
************

To install the library from PyPI, simply use `pip`, or `conda`:

.. code:: console

   pip install MPSPlots
   conda install --channels martinpdes mpsplots

For a development version, clone the GitHub repository and install the dependencies manually:

.. code:: console

   git clone https://github.com/MartinPdeS/MPSPlots.git
   cd MPSPlots
   pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt

This setup ensures that you have access to the latest updates and features under active development.

----

Usage
*****

**MPSPlots** can be integrated into your scientific workflow with minimal effort. Here’s a simple example showing how you can create a 2D Matplotlib plot:

.. code:: python

   from MPSPlots.render2D import Scene

   plot = Scene()
   plot.add_line(x_data, y_data, label="Sample Line")
   plot.show()

For more complex 3D visualizations using PyVista:

.. code:: python

   from MPSPlots.render3D import Scene

   plot = Scene()
   plot.add_surface(mesh)
   plot.show()

Whether it's a 2D line chart or a 3D surface plot, **MPSPlots** makes it simple to generate publication-quality visualizations quickly.

----

Testing and Development
***********************

If you want to contribute to the project or test it locally, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:

   .. code:: console

      cd MPSPlots

2. Install dependencies:

   .. code:: console

      pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt

3. Run the tests with coverage:

   .. code:: console

      coverage run --source=MPSPlots --module pytest --verbose tests
      coverage report --show-missing

These commands will ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies and will run the tests, providing you with a detailed report on code coverage and any potential issues.
