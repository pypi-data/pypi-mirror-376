Purpose
*******

Plugin for adding translation behavior to XBlocks. This plugin assumes:

1. Translations IDA is setup (https://github.com/edx/ai-translations).

2. Frontend plugin setup to add translation selector.

When present and enabled, requesting a ``src_lang`` and ``dest_lang`` as query params in a unit render
should request and return translated versions of those XBlocks' content.

**WARNING**: This replaces some native XBlocks from ``edx-platform`` and replaces them with custom versions.
While we only override small portions of functionality, there is a chance this will cause things to "spookily"
break. See `translatable_xblocks/apps.py <translatable_xblocks/apps.py>`_ for where we do this block replacement.
