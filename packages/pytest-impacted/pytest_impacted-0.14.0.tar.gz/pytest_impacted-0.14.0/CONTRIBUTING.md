   - Write clear, readable code
   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   - Add docstrings to new functions and classes
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

3. **Add tests** for your changes:
   - All new functionality should include tests
   - Ensure existing tests still pass
   - Aim for good test coverage

4. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   pytest

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Development Workflow

1. Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicate work

3. Create a focused branch for each feature or bug fix
4. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
5. Keep PRs reasonably sized and focused
6. Be responsive to feedback during code review
