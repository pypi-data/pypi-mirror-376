    *Making Synthetic Data Easy*
</center>

Welcome to the SynthGenAI documentation. SynthGenAI is a package for generating synthetic datasets using LLMs. This documentation will guide you through the installation, usage, and examples of how to use SynthGenAI.

## Overview üßê

SynthGenAI is designed to be modular and can be easily extended to include different API providers for LLMs and new features.

## Why SynthGenAI? ü§î

Interest in synthetic data generation has surged recently, driven by the growing recognition of data as a critical asset in AI development. As [Ilya Sutskever](https://youtu.be/1yvBqasHLZs), one of the most important figures in AI, says: 'Data is the fossil fuel of AI.' The more quality data we have, the better our models can perform.

However, access to data is often restricted due to privacy concerns, or it may be prohibitively expensive to collect. Additionally, the vast amount of high-quality data on the internet has already been extensively mined. Synthetic data generation addresses these challenges by allowing us to create diverse and useful datasets using current pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs).

Beyond LLMs, synthetic data also holds immense potential for pre-training and post-training of Small Language Models (SLMs), which are gaining popularity due to their efficiency and suitability for specific, resource-constrained applications. By leveraging synthetic data for both LLMs and SLMs, we can enhance performance across a wide range of use cases while balancing resource efficiency and model effectiveness. This approach enables us to harness the strengths of both synthetic and authentic datasets to achieve optimal outcomes.

## Tools used for building SynthGenAI üß∞

The package is built using Python and the following libraries:

- [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
