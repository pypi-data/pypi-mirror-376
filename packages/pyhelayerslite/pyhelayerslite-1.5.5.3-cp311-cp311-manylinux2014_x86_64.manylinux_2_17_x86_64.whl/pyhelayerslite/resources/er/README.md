# A nickname to normalized name mapping

This file maps possible nicknames or shorthands to a normalized version of a personal name.
This is used by the ER (Privacy-Preserving Record-Linkage) when pre-processing the record name fields.

The above original file was modified for the purpose of ER, by making it into a 1 to 1 map between a nickname
and the main alternative normalized name, and removing duplicates.
