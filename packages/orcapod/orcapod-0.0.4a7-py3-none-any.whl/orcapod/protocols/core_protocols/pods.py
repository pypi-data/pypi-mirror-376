class Pod(Kernel, Protocol):
    """
    Specialized kernel for packet-level processing with advanced caching.

    Pods represent a different computational model from regular kernels:
    - Process data one packet at a time (enabling fine-grained parallelism)
    - Support just-in-time evaluation (computation deferred until needed)
    - Provide stricter type contracts (clear input/output schemas)
    - Enable advanced caching strategies (packet-level caching)

    The Pod abstraction is ideal for:
    - Expensive computations that benefit from caching
    - Operations that can be parallelized at the packet level
    - Transformations with strict type contracts
    - Processing that needs to be deferred until access time
    - Functions that operate on individual data items

    Pods use a different execution model where computation is deferred
    until results are actually needed, enabling efficient resource usage
    and fine-grained caching.
