        Create a prediction using an
        [official model](https://replicate.com/changelog/2025-01-29-official-models).

        If you're _not_ running an official model, use the
        [`predictions.create`](#predictions.create) operation instead.

        Example cURL request:

        ```console
        curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \\
          -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Write a short poem about the weather."}}' \\
          -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \\
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
          https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct/predictions
        ```

        The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is
        exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be
        retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpoint.

        For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out
        our documentation on
        [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction)
        which covers a variety of use cases.

        Args:
          input: The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you
              are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you
              are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its
              `openapi_schema` property. For example,
              [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as
              an input.

              Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.

              Use an HTTP URL when:

              - you have a large file > 256kb
              - you want to be able to use the file multiple times
              - you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

              Use a data URL when:

              - you have a small file <= 256kb
              - you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
              - you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

          stream: **This field is deprecated.**

              Request a URL to receive streaming output using
              [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

              This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a
              `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

          webhook: An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The
              webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the
              response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are
              network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be
              safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending
              webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve
              without redirecting.

          webhook_events_filter: By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new
              outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger
              webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction
              request:

              - `start`: immediately on prediction start
              - `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions
                can generate multiple outputs)
              - `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
              - `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state
                (succeeded/canceled/failed)

              For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the
              prediction, you would provide:

              ```json
              {
                "input": {
                  "text": "Alice"
                },
                "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
                "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
              }
              ```

              Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every
              500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be
              sent regardless of throttling.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

          extra_body: Add additional JSON properties to the request

          timeout: Override the client-level default timeout for this request, in seconds
