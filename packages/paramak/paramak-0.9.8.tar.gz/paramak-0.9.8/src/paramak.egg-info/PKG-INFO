# Paramak

Paramak python package allows rapid production of 3D CAD models and neutronics
models of fusion reactors.

The purpose of Paramak is to provide geometry for parameter studies and therefore the models are created from parameters.

Paramak produces [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/CadQuery) objects which can easily be saved to CAD files in several formats (STEP, STL, BRep) and also readily convertable to DAGMC h5m neutronics geometry using tools such as [Cad-to_DAGMC](https://github.com/fusion-energy/cad_to_dagmc).

:point_right: Please see the [online documentation](https://fusion-energy.github.io/paramak) for installation, usage and API documentation.
