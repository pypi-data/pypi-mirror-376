========

There are two main reactors to choose from:

* Tokamak
* Spherical Tokamak.

The reactors can be varied in terms of their radial build, vertical build, elongation and triangularity which gives a lot of variability.
All reactors can be built with either:

* A radial and vertical build which gives more control of the size of components allowing reactor blankets to vary both radially and vertically.
* A radial build and plasma elongation which assumes the vertical build matches the radial build and allows the reactors to be built with a minimal number of parameters.

It is also easy to add additional components such as:

* divertors
* poloidal magnets
* toroidal magnets
* your own CadQuery shapes / workplanes

These examples show how to make various reactors with different options.
