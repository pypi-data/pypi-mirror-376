## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### For Development
1. **Use Safe Launch Config**: Select "Safe Training (Low Memory)" in VS Code
2. **Monitor Memory**: Run "Start Memory Monitor" task before heavy operations
3. **Emergency Cleanup**: Use "Emergency Cleanup" task if issues arise

### For Training
```python
from src.utils.crash_prevention import safe_execution, memory_safe_context

@safe_execution(max_retries=2, memory_threshold=0.85)
def train_model():
    with memory_safe_context(threshold=0.80):
        # Your training code here
        pass
```

### For Data Loading
```python
from src.data.safe_loaders import load_monai_decathlon_safe

# Safe data loading with automatic memory management
dataset = load_monai_decathlon_safe(
    root_dir="./data",
    task="Task01_BrainTumour",
    batch_size=2,  # Will be automatically reduced if needed
    cache_rate=0.1  # Conservative caching
)
```

## üìù Usage Commands

### VS Code Integration
- **Start Memory Monitor**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "Start Memory Monitor"
- **Safe Training**: `F5` ‚Üí Select "Safe Training (Low Memory)"
- **Emergency Cleanup**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "Emergency Cleanup"

### Command Line
```bash
# Test the system
python -c "from src.utils.crash_prevention import MemoryMonitor; print('System operational:', MemoryMonitor().check_memory()['status'])"

# Run safe training
python src/training/train_enhanced.py --config config/safe_training.json

# Monitor memory usage
python scripts/monitoring/memory_monitor.py
```
