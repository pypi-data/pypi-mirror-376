## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If VSCode Becomes Unresponsive
1. **Don't force quit yet** - try emergency cleanup first:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/monitoring/emergency_stop.sh
   ```

2. **If still frozen**, run recovery:
   ```bash
   python recovery/recovery_assistant.py
   ```

3. **Check system status**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/monitoring/vscode_crash_monitor.py --action report
   ```

### After a Crash
1. **Run recovery assistant**:
   ```bash
   python recovery/recovery_assistant.py
   ```
2. **Select option 1** to restore latest backup
3. **Check system status** before restarting work

```bash
# Check if system is ready
./scripts/training/cleanup_resources.sh
```

### Progressive Training Approach
```bash
# 1. Test with minimal load
./scripts/training/ultra_light_training.sh

# 2. If stable, try conservative mode
./scripts/training/vscode_safe_training.sh 2 1

# 3. If still stable, increase gradually
./scripts/training/vscode_safe_training.sh 5 2
```

### Emergency Mode
If VSCode becomes unresponsive:
1. Open terminal outside VSCode
2. Kill training processes: `pkill -f train_enhanced.py`
3. Run cleanup: `./scripts/training/cleanup_resources.sh`
4. Restart VSCode

## Warning Signs

üö® **Stop training immediately if you see:**
- VSCode becoming slow or unresponsive
- System memory > 85%
- High swap usage
- System lag or freezing

## Memory Reduction Tips

### Browser
- Close unnecessary tabs
- Use `chrome://discards/` to check memory usage
- Consider lightweight browsers during training

### VSCode
- Close unused editor tabs
- Disable heavy extensions temporarily
- Use `Developer: Reload Window` to refresh

### System
- Close other applications
- Check `htop` for memory-heavy processes
- Consider increasing swap space if needed

## Troubleshooting

### "System not safe for training"
1. Run cleanup script
2. Close browser tabs
3. Close other applications
4. Wait a few minutes
5. Try ultra-light mode

### Training fails to start
1. Check virtual environment: `ls -la .venv/`
2. Verify dependencies: `source .venv/bin/activate && pip list`
3. Check available memory: `free -h`

### VSCode crashes during training
1. Restart VSCode
2. Use ultra-light mode only
3. Consider training outside VSCode
4. Check system specifications

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Resource Limits
Edit scripts to modify limits:
```bash
# In vscode_safe_training.sh
MEMORY_SAFE_LIMIT=65.0    # Default: 65%
CPU_SAFE_LIMIT=70.0       # Default: 70%
MIN_MEMORY_GB=4           # Default: 4GB
```

### Thread Limits
Adjust for your system:
```bash
# For 4-core systems
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2

# For 8-core systems
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
```
