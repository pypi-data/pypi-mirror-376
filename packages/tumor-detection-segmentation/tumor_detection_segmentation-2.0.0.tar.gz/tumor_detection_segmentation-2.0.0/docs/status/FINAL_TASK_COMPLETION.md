## 🔧 What I Just Implemented

### 1. **Task 10: Inference Post-processing**
Added CLI flags to `src/inference/inference.py`:
- `--postproc` - Enable post-processing
- `--fill-holes` - Morphological hole filling
- `--largest-component` - Keep largest connected component
- `--min-component-size` - Remove small components

### 2. **Task 11: Enhanced Metrics System**
Created `src/evaluation/evaluate_enhanced.py`:
- HD95 (95th percentile Hausdorff Distance) metrics
- ASSD (Average Symmetric Surface Distance) integration
- MLflow logging with `--mlflow` flag
- Comprehensive evaluation pipeline

### 3. **Task 12: CI/CD Pipeline**
Created complete automation:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks
- `config/requirements/requirements-ci.txt` - CI dependencies
- Multi-Python testing (3.8-3.11)
- Security scanning (Trivy) + SBOM generation

## 📝 Usage Examples

**Post-processing inference:**
```bash
python src/inference/inference.py --model MODEL --config CONFIG \
  --input IMAGE --postproc --fill-holes --largest-component
```

**Enhanced evaluation:**
```bash
python src/evaluation/evaluate_enhanced.py \
  --predictions pred_dir --ground-truth gt_dir --mlflow
```
