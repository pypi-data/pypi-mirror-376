# maxs

**Build AI tools while talking to them**

Stop writing configs. Stop restarting servers. Just speak:

*"max, create a tool that monitors our Kubernetes cluster"*  
‚Üí Tool created, tested, and running in 30 seconds

## üöÄ Try it now (2 minutes)

```bash
pipx install maxs && maxs
```

Then just speak:
- *"max, what time is it?"* ‚Üí Instant response  
- *"max, create a weather tool"* ‚Üí Tool appears in ./tools/
- *"max, use the weather tool for Tokyo"* ‚Üí Working immediately

**No configuration. No API keys. No YAML files.**

## üí° How it works

```
Voice Command ‚Üí Hot Reload Tool Creation ‚Üí Instant Usage
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
"max, create X"    ./tools/X.py saved    Tool ready to use
```

**Three revolutionary features:**

üéôÔ∏è **Voice-First Development** - Build tools by talking  
üî• **Instant Hot Reload** - Tools work immediately, no restart  
üì° **P2P Agent Network** - Agents communicate over encrypted mesh

## ‚ö° Setup (choose one)

**Option 1: Local AI (recommended for privacy)**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull qwen3:4b
maxs
```

**Option 2: Cloud AI (recommended for power)**
```bash
# Anthropic Claude (best for development)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
MODEL_PROVIDER=anthropic maxs

# OpenAI GPT (good for general tasks)  
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai maxs

# Other: bedrock, github, litellm, llamaapi, mistral
```

## üî• Key Features

### üéôÔ∏è **Voice-Powered Development**
```bash
maxs
> listen(action="start", trigger_keyword="max")

# Then just speak naturally:
"max, analyze the server logs"     ‚Üí Creates monitoring tools
"max, deploy to staging"          ‚Üí Runs deployment scripts  
"max, create a backup system"     ‚Üí Builds automation instantly
```

### üîÑ **Instant Hot Reload**
Create tools while maxs is running:
```python
# Save this to ./tools/weather.py
from strands import tool

@tool
def weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f"Weather for {city}: 72¬∞F, sunny"
```

Then immediately use it:
```bash
maxs "get weather for Tokyo"  # Tool works instantly!
```

### üì° **P2P Agent Network**
Agents communicate over encrypted Bluetooth mesh:
```bash
# Agent Alice says:
"max, analyze the server performance"

# Agent Bob automatically responds:
"Performance analysis complete. CPU at 85%, recommend scaling."

# No internet required - direct agent-to-agent communication
```

### üß† **Intelligent Memory**
Remembers everything across sessions:
```bash
maxs "remember: we're using PostgreSQL for user data"
# Later...
maxs "create a user analytics tool"  # Uses PostgreSQL context
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Workflows

### Development & Automation
```bash
maxs "analyze this codebase and suggest improvements"
maxs "create deployment script for our Docker app"  
maxs "monitor system logs in the background"
maxs "format all Python files in this project"
```

### Data Analysis
```bash
maxs "connect to PostgreSQL and analyze user growth"
maxs "create charts from the sales CSV file"
maxs "query the API and generate a report"
```

### Voice Control (Hands-Free)
```bash
# Start voice mode first
maxs
> listen(action="start", trigger_keyword="max")

# Then just speak:
"max, what's the system status?"
"max, backup the database" 
"max, check for security updates"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

**Local-first by design:**
- Core functionality works completely offline
- Conversation history stored locally in `/tmp/.maxs/`
- Custom tools saved in `./tools/` directory
- No external data transmission except to chosen AI provider

**Optional cloud features** (when enabled):
- AWS Bedrock for knowledge base (requires AWS credentials)
- Team collaboration via EventBridge (optional)
- External APIs only when explicitly used (GitHub, Slack, etc.)

## üîß Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Common Issues</strong></summary>

**AI Provider Problems:**
```bash
# Try local model as fallback
ollama serve && ollama pull qwen3:4b

```

**Voice Recognition Issues:**
```bash
maxs
> listen(action="list_devices")  # Check available microphones
```

**Tool Loading Problems:**
```bash
# Reset and enable all tools
STRANDS_TOOLS="ALL" maxs
```

**Database Connection Issues:**
