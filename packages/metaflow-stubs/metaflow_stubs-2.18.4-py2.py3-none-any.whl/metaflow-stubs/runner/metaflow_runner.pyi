    """
    This class contains a reference to a `metaflow.Run` object representing
    the currently executing or finished run, as well as metadata related
    to the process.
    
    `ExecutingRun` is returned by methods in `Runner` and `NBRunner`. It is not
    meant to be instantiated directly.
    
    This class works as a context manager, allowing you to use a pattern like
    ```python
    with Runner(...).run() as running:
        ...
    ```
    Note that you should use either this object as the context manager or
    `Runner`, not both in a nested manner.

        ----------
        timeout : float, optional, default None
            The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the run to finish.

class Runner(object, metaclass=RunnerMeta):
    """
    Metaflow's Runner API that presents a programmatic interface
    to run flows and perform other operations either synchronously or asynchronously.
    The class expects a path to the flow file along with optional arguments
    that match top-level options on the command-line.
    
    This class works as a context manager, calling `cleanup()` to remove
    temporary files at exit.
    
    Example:
    ```python
    with Runner('slowflow.py', pylint=False) as runner:
        result = runner.run(alpha=5, tags=["abc", "def"], max_workers=5)
        print(result.run.finished)

    ----------
    flow_file : str
        Path to the flow file to run, relative to current directory.
    show_output : bool, default True
        Show the 'stdout' and 'stderr' to the console by default,
        Only applicable for synchronous 'run' and 'resume' functions.
    profile : str, optional, default None
        Metaflow profile to use to run this run. If not specified, the default
        profile is used (or the one already set using `METAFLOW_PROFILE`)
    env : Dict[str, str], optional, default None
        Additional environment variables to set for the Run. This overrides the
        environment set for this process.
    cwd : str, optional, default None
        The directory to run the subprocess in; if not specified, the current
        directory is used.
    file_read_timeout : int, default 3600
        The timeout until which we try to read the runner attribute file (in seconds).

        Additional arguments that you would pass to `python myflow.py` before
