## 🎓 Educational Value

This tool serves as both a practical analysis instrument and an educational resource:

1. **Learn SOLID Principles**: Understand how each principle applies in real code
2. **Contextual Understanding**: See how requirements change based on project type
3. **Practical Application**: Get actionable advice rather than abstract theory
4. **Progressive Improvement**: Track improvements over time with consistent metrics

## 🏆 Why This Tool is Different

Unlike traditional static analysis tools that apply rigid rules uniformly, SOLID Checker understands that **context matters**:

- **No More Over-Engineering Warnings** for simple scripts that don't need complex architecture
- **Stricter Standards** for libraries and frameworks where quality is paramount  
- **Balanced Approach** for typical applications with practical recommendations
- **Educational Feedback** that helps developers understand *why* certain principles matter more in different contexts

**Result**: More practical, actionable, and contextually appropriate SOLID analysis that helps you write better code without unnecessary complexity.
