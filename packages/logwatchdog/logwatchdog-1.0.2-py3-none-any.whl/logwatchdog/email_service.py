"""
Email Service Module
====================

This module provides email notification functionality for the LogWatchdog system.
It handles sending alert emails when exceptions are detected in monitored log files.

The service uses SMTP to send emails and supports:
- TLS encryption for secure email transmission
- Configurable SMTP server settings
- Multiple recipient support
- Parameter-based configuration
- Error handling and logging

Configuration is passed as parameters for security and flexibility.

    Send email to all recipients in the configured receiver group.
    
    This function creates and sends an email alert using the configured SMTP

    Args:
        subject (str): The email subject line
        body (str): The email body content
        smtp_server (str): SMTP server address

    Raises:
        smtplib.SMTPException: If there's an SMTP-related error
        Exception: For any other unexpected errors during email sending
        
    Note:
        - Uses TLS encryption for security
        - Sends to all recipients in receiver_group
        - Logs success/failure messages to console
