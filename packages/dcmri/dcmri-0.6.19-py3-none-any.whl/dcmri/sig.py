    Args:
        R1 (array-like): Longitudinal relaxation rates in 1/sec. For a tissue 
          with n compartments, the first dimension of R1 must be n. For a
          single compartment, R1 can be scalar or a 1D time-array.
        T (array-like): duration of free recovery.
        v (array-like, optional): volume fractions of the compartments. For a 
          one-compartment tissue this is a scalar - otherwise it is an 
          array with one value for each compartment. Defaults to 1.
        Fw (array-like, optional): Water flow between the compartments and to 
          the environment, in units of mL/sec/cm3. Generally Fw must be a nxn 
          array, where n is the number of compartments, and the off-diagonal 
          elements Fw[j,i] are the permeability for water moving from 
          compartment i into j. The diagonal elements Fw[i,i] quantify the 
          flow of water from compartment i to outside. For a closed system 
          with equal permeabilities between all compartments, a scalar value 
          for Fw can be provided. Defaults to 0.
        j (array-like, optional): normalized tissue magnetization flux. j has 
          to have the same shape as R1. Defaults to None.
        n0 (array-like, optional): initial relative magnetization at T=0. 
          If this is a scalar, all compartments are assumed to have the same 
          initial magnetization. Defaults to 0.
        me (array-like, optional): equilibrium magnetization of the tissue 
          compartments. If a scalar value is provided, all compartments are 
          assumed to have the same equilibrium magnetization. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Magnetization in the compartments after a time T.

        >>> plt.show()

        Now consider a two-compartment model, with a central compartment 
        that has in- and outflow, and a peripheral compartment that only 
        exchanges with the central compartment:

        >>> R1 = [1,2]
        >>> v = [0.3, 0.7]
        >>> PS = 0.1
        >>> Fw = [[f, PS], [PS, 0]]
        >>> Mz = dc.Mz_free(R1, TI, v, Fw, n0=-1, j=[f, 0])

        >>> plt.plot(TI, Mz[0,:], label='Central compartment', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.plot(TI, Mz[1,:], label='Peripheral compartment', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.xlabel('Inversion time (sec)')
        >>> plt.ylabel('Magnetization (A/cm)')
        >>> plt.legend()
        >>> plt.show()

        In DC-MRI the more usual situation is one where TI is fixed and the 
        relaxation rates are variable due to the effect of a contrast agent. 
        As an illustration, consider the previous result again at TI=500 msec 
        and an R1 that is linearly declining in the central compartment and 
        constant in the peripheral compartment:

        >>> TI = 0.5
        >>> nt = 1000
        >>> t = 0.1*np.arange(nt)
        >>> R1 = np.stack((1-t/np.amax(t), np.ones(nt)))
        >>> j = np.stack((f*np.ones(nt), np.zeros(nt)))
        >>> Mz = dc.Mz_free(R1, TI, v, Fw, n0=-1, j=j)

        >>> plt.plot(t, Mz[0,:], label='Central compartment', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.plot(t, Mz[1,:], label='Peripheral compartment', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.xlabel('Time (sec)')
        >>> plt.ylabel('Magnetization (A/cm)')
        >>> plt.legend()
        >>> plt.show()   

        The function allows for R1 and TI to be both variable. Computing the 
        result for 10 different TI values and extracting the result 
        corresponding to TI=0.5 gives again the same result:

        >>> TI = 0.1*np.arange(10)
        >>> Mz = dc.Mz_free(R1, TI, v, Fw, n0=-1, j=j)

        >>> plt.plot(t, Mz[0,:,5], label='Central compartment', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.plot(t, Mz[1,:,5], label='Peripheral compartment', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.xlabel('Time (sec)')
        >>> plt.ylabel('Magnetization (A/cm)')
        >>> plt.legend()
        >>> plt.show()

    See section :ref:`basics-relaxation-T1` for more detail.

    Args:
        R1 (array-like): Longitudinal relaxation rates in 1/sec. For a tissue 
          with n compartments, the first dimension of R1 must be n. For a
          single compartment, R1 can be scalar or a 1D time-array.
        T (float): time since the first rf-pulse.
        TR (float): repetition time between rf-pulses.
        FA (float): flip angle of the rf-pulse.
        TP (float, optional): preparation delay. Default is 0.
        v (array-like, optional): volume fractions of the compartments. For a 
          one-compartment tissue this is a scalar - otherwise it is an 
          array with one value for each compartment. Defaults to 1.
        Fw (array-like, optional): Water flow between the compartments and to 
          the environment, in units of mL/sec/cm3. Generally Fw must be a nxn 
          array, where n is the number of compartments, and the off-diagonal 
          elements Fw[j,i] are the permeability for water moving from 
          compartment i into j. The diagonal elements Fw[i,i] quantify the 
          flow of water from compartment i to outside. For a closed system 
          with equal permeabilities between all compartments, a scalar value 
          for Fw can be provided. Defaults to 0.
        j (array-like, optional): normalized tissue magnetization flux. j has 
          to have the same shape as R1. Defaults to None.
        n0 (array-like, optional): initial relative magnetization at T=0. 
          If this is a scalar, all compartments are assumed to have the same 
          initial magnetization. Defaults to 0.
        me (array-like, optional): equilibrium magnetization of the tissue 
          compartments. If a scalar value is provided, all compartments are 
          assumed to have the same equilibrium magnetization. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Tissue magnetization in the compartments after a time T.

    Example:

        Compare SPGR tissue magnetization of a two-compartment tissue
        after inversion against free recovery and steady-state:

    .. plot::
        :include-source:
        :context: close-figs

        Import packages:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> import dcmri as dc

        Define constants:

        >>> FA, TR, TP = 12, 0.005, 0
        >>> TI = np.linspace(0,3,100)
        >>> R1 = [1, 0.5]
        >>> v = [0.3, 0.7]
        >>> f, PS = 0.5, 0.1
        >>> Fw = [[f, PS], [PS, 0]]

        Compute magnetization:

        >>> Mspgr = dc.Mz_spgr(R1, TI, TR, FA, TP, v, Fw, j=[f, 0], n0=-1) 
        >>> Mfree = dc.Mz_free(R1, TI, v, Fw, j=[f, 0], n0=-1)
        >>> Mss = dc.Mz_ss(R1, TR, FA, v, Fw, j=[f, 0])

        Plot the results for the peripheral compartment:

        >>> c = 1
        >>> plt.title('Peripheral compartment')
        >>> plt.plot(TI, Mfree[c,:], label='Free', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.plot(TI, v[c]+0*TI, label='Equilibrium', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.plot(TI, Mspgr[c,:], label='SPGR', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.plot(TI, Mss[c]+0*TI, label='Steady-state', linewidth=3)
        >>> plt.xlabel('Time since start of pulse sequence (sec)')
        >>> plt.ylabel('Tissue magnetization (A/cm/cm3)')
        >>> plt.legend()
        >>> plt.show()

        This verifies that the free recovery magnetization goes to equilibrium, 
        and that the SPGR magnetization relaxes to the steady state at a 
        shorter time than the free recovery.

        We generate some signals from ground-truth concentrations, then reconstruct the concentrations and check against the ground truth:

    .. plot::
        :include-source:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> import dcmri as dc

        First define some constants:

        >>> T10 = 1         # sec
        >>> TC = 0.2        # sec
        >>> r1 = 0.005      # Hz/M
        >>> FA = 15         # deg

        Generate ground truth concentrations and signal data:

        >>> t = np.arange(0, 5*60, 0.1)     # sec
        >>> C = 0.003*(1-np.exp(-t/60))     # M
        >>> R1 = 1/T10 + r1*C               # Hz
        >>> S = dc.signal_free(100, R1, TC, FA)  # au

        Reconstruct the concentrations from the signal data:

        >>> Crec = dc.conc_src(S, TC, T10, r1)

        Check results by plotting ground truth against reconstruction:

        >>> plt.plot(t/60, 1000*C, 'ro', label='Ground truth')
        >>> plt.plot(t/60, 1000*Crec, 'b-', label='Reconstructed')
        >>> plt.title('SRC signal inverse')
        >>> plt.xlabel('Time (min)')
