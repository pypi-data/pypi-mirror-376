## **What is Sage Agent?**

**Sage is an AI-native notebook assistant that supercharges your existing Jupyter workflows.**

Built by leading AI and quant researchers from YC, Harvard, MIT, and Goldman Sachs, Sage brings real-time, context-aware assistance directly into JupyterLab.

Use natural language to clean data, write analysis code, debug errors, explore dataframes, and build models‚Äîfaster and with fewer mistakes.

**No hallucinated code. No context switching. Just faster insights.**

---

## **Why Use Sage Agent in Jupyter?**

Whether you‚Äôre a quant, data scientist, or analyst living in notebooks, Sage helps you:

‚úÖ Clean and transform messy data in seconds

‚úÖ Visualize trends, rollups, and anomalies from a prompt

‚úÖ¬†Connect your custom databases in one click and easily explore from notebooks 

‚úÖ Generate *runnable* Python or SQL that fits your current cell + variable context

‚úÖ Auto-detect schema changes and debug downstream errors

‚úÖ Stay private: run entirely *local-first* or in your own secure VPC

‚úÖ Extend JupyterLab without changing how you work

---

## **Perfect For:**

- Data scientists cleaning huge CSVs
- Quant researchers testing ML pipelines
- Product and analytics teams tired of building dashboards and flaky notebooks
- Anyone tired of LLM tools that break their code

---

## **Installation**

### **üì¶ Requirements**

- JupyterLab >= 4.0.0
- NodeJS (for development)

### **üß† Install Sage Agent:**

```
pip install jupyterlab signalpilot_ai_internal
```

### **‚ùå Uninstall:**

```
pip uninstall signalpilot_ai_internal
```

---

## **How to Get Started**

To unlock full functionality, you‚Äôll need Sage API credentials.

üëâ [**Request your API key**](https://sagebook.ai/#contact) or email us at [contact@sagebook.ai](mailto:contact@sagebook.ai)

---

## **Why Sage**

- ‚úÖ Context-aware code gen: understands variables, dataframes, imports, and prior cells
- ‚úÖ AI that *fixes* schema issues and silent join bugs
- ‚úÖ Inline review + diffs before you run any code
- ‚úÖ Visualizations via natural language (matplotlib, plotly, seaborn supported)
- ‚úÖ BYO LLM: Anthropic, OpenAI, vLLM, Ollama, or HF endpoints
- ‚úÖ Built to run in air-gapped / enterprise environments

---

## **Local Development Instructions**

To contribute or develop locally:

```
# Clone the repo and enter the directory
git clone https://github.com/sagebook/signalpilot_ai_internal.git
cd signalpilot_ai_internal

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e "."

# Link extension to JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite

# Rebuild on changes
jlpm build
```

For auto-rebuild while editing:

```
# Watch source
jlpm watch

# Run JupyterLab in parallel
jupyter lab
```

---

## **Uninstall in Dev Mode**

```
pip uninstall signalpilot_ai_internal
# Then manually remove labextension symlink from JupyterLab extensions dir.
```

**Built for teams working with sensitive data:**

- Zero data retention by default
- Optional BYO keys for Claude, OpenAI, or local models
- Notebook-specific controls for what the model can ‚Äúsee‚Äù
- Fine-grained telemetry settings
