# GeneralAnalysis Guardrails SDK - Developer Guide

## Quick Start

```python
import generalanalysis

# Initialize client (uses GA_API_KEY environment variable)
client = generalanalysis.Client()

# Invoke a guardrail
result = client.guards.invoke(guard_id=3, text="Contact john@example.com")

# You can use either use result.block for binary decisions or policy.violation_prob for your own tunable threshold-based filtering
if result.block:
    print("Content blocked!")
    for policy in result.policies:
        if not policy.passed:
            print(f"  Violated: {policy.name} - {policy.definition}")
            print(f"  Confidence: {policy.violation_prob:.2%}")
```

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install the SDK
pip install generalanalysis

# Set your API key
export GA_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## Core Operations

### List Available Guards
```python
guards = client.guards.list() -> List[Guard]
```
Returns a list of all accessible guards with their policies and configurations.

### Get Guard Details
```python
guard = client.guards.get(guard_id: int) -> Guard
```
Returns detailed information about a specific guard including all associated policies.

### Invoke a Guard
```python
result = client.guards.invoke(
    guard_id: int,
    text: str
) -> GuardInvokeResult
```
Checks the provided text against the guard's policies and returns violation results.

### View Invocation Logs
```python
logs = client.guards.list_logs(
    guard_id: Optional[int] = None,  # Filter by guard
    page: int = 1,                   # Page number
    page_size: int = 50              # Items per page (max 100)
) -> PaginatedLogsResponse
```
Returns paginated logs of guard invocations. Each log entry contains:
- `id`: Log entry ID
- `user_id`: User who invoked the guard
- `guard_id`: Guard that was invoked
- `input_text`: Text that was evaluated
- `result`: GuardInvokeResult containing block status, latency, policies, and raw data
- `created_at`: Timestamp

## Data Types

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

class Guard:
    id: int
    name: str
    description: str
    hf_id: Optional[str]
    endpoint: str
    system_prompt: Optional[str]
    policies: List[GuardPolicy]

class GuardPolicy:
    id: int
    name: str
    definition: str

class GuardInvokeResult:
    block: bool                       # Whether content should be blocked
    latency_ms: float                 # Processing time in milliseconds
    policies: List[PolicyEvaluation]  # Individual policy results
    raw: Dict[str, Any]              # Raw response data from the guard

class PolicyEvaluation:
    name: str                    # Policy identifier (e.g., "EMAIL_ADDRESS")
    definition: str              # Policy description
    passed: bool                 # True if policy check passed (no violation)
    violation_prob: float        # Probability/confidence score (0.0-1.0) of violation

class GuardLog:
    id: int
    user_id: str
    guard_id: int
    input_text: str
    created_at: str
    result: GuardInvokeResult | Dict[str, Any]  # Evaluation result (GuardInvokeResult for success, dict with error for failures)

class PaginatedLogsResponse:
    items: List[GuardLog]
    total: int
    page: int
    page_size: int
    total_pages: int
```

## Async Support

The SDK provides async versions of all methods with identical signatures and return types:

```python
async with generalanalysis.AsyncClient() as client:
    guards = await client.guards.list() -> List[Guard]
    guard = await client.guards.get(guard_id: int) -> Guard
    result = await client.guards.invoke(guard_id: int, text: str) -> GuardInvokeResult
    logs = await client.guards.list_logs(...) -> PaginatedLogsResponse
```

## Error Handling

```python
from generalanalysis import (
    GuardNotFoundError,
    AuthenticationError,
    GeneralAnalysisError
)

try:
    result = client.guards.invoke(guard_id=999, text="test")
except GuardNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Invalid guard ID: {e}")
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
except GeneralAnalysisError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
```

## API Reference

**Authentication**: Bearer token via `GA_API_KEY` environment variable
