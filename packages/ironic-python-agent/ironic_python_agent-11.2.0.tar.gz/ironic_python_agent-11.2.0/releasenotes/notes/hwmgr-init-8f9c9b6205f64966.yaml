deprecations:

    Some hardware managers include complex initialization logic in their
    ``evaluate_hardware_support`` calls. This behavior could cause various
    issues (such as recursion on attempt to invoke other hardware manager
    calls) and is now deprecated. Please move the initialization login into
    the new ``initialize`` call, which is guaranteed to run after all
    hardware managers have been cached and only for enabled hardware managers.
