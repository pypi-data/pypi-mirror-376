    The ``agent_token_required`` configuration option has been removed.
    This was a knob to help ease the upgrade process by enabling operators
    to express if their environment was requiring an agent token. This was
    key to help navigate possible upgrade cases, however that was for the
    migration *to* the Victoria release, and such an upgrade is outside
    of the version support matrix of Ironic.
