    Adds a new configuration option `[DEFAULT]image_download_max_duration`,
    which enforces a maximum total duration (in seconds) allowed for
    downloading an image. If this threshold is exceeded, the download is
    aborted with a non-retryable `ImageDownloadTimeoutError` exception.

    A value of 0 (the default) disables this feature.
