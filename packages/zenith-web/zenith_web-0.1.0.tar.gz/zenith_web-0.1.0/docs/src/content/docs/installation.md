## Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check Zenith CLI is available
zen --version

# Check Python import works
python -c "import zenith; print(zenith.__version__)"
```

## Development Setup

For development, we recommend setting up a virtual environment:

**venv:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Zenith (production dependencies included)
pip install zenith-web

# Add development tools
pip install "zenith-web[dev]"
```

**uv:**
```bash
# uv manages virtual environments automatically
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# Add Zenith (production dependencies included)
uv add zenith-web

# Add development tools if needed
uv add "zenith-web[dev]"

# Run commands
uv run zen --version
```

## IDE Setup

### VS Code

Install recommended extensions for the best experience:

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-python.vscode-pylance",
    "ms-python.black-formatter",
    "charliermarsh.ruff",
    "tamasfe.even-better-toml"
  ]
}
```

### PyCharm

1. Set Python interpreter to your virtual environment
2. Enable type checking in settings
3. Configure Black as the code formatter

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/zenith_dev

# Redis (optional)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Environment
DEBUG=true
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## Docker Setup (Optional)

For containerized development:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: zenith
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: zenith
      POSTGRES_DB: zenith_dev
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

Start services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you get import errors, ensure:
- Python 3.11+ is being used
- Virtual environment is activated
- Zenith is installed in the current environment

### Command Not Found

If `zen` command is not found:
- Check if it's in your PATH
- Try `python -m zenith.cli` instead
- Reinstall with `pip install --force-reinstall zenith-web`
