# mediaComp 
MediaComp is a free and open-source conversion of the multimedia library JES4PY by Mark Guzdial to Python 3. It utilizes multiple popular libraries to provide an abstraction of manipulating sounds, images, and colors. 

## Installation
Before installing mediaComp, verify that Python is installed on your device. To find out, open a command prompt or terminal and type:

```python --version ```

If a message like "Python 3.12.5" is displayed it means Python is installed and you can install mediaComp. If an error message occurs, check the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/) to download it. 

To install our package run:

```python -m pip install mediaComp```

## Help

If you are new to mediaComp you should be able to start faily easily. Our abstraction make the functionality of the library intuitive. Full documentation can be found on our [GitHub](https://github.com/dllargent/mediaComp).
