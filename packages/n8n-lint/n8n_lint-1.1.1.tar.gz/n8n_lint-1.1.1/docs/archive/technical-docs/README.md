# Technical Documentation Archive

This directory contains technical documentation that was archived to keep the n8n-lint tool simple and focused.

## Archived Files

- `technical.md` - Over-engineered architecture documentation
- `console-output-formatting-plan.md` - Complex planning documents

## What Was Removed

- Complex architecture documentation
- Over-engineered technical specifications
- Extensive planning documents
- Detailed implementation guides

## Why It Was Archived

The technical documentation was too complex for a simple CLI tool:

1. **Over-Engineering** - Too detailed for a simple tool
2. **Feature Creep** - Moved beyond core functionality
3. **Maintenance Burden** - Would require ongoing updates
4. **User Confusion** - Too complex for simple use cases

## Current Approach

The tool now focuses on:

- Simple, clear documentation
- Essential functionality only
- Developer-focused content
- Lean, maintainable docs

## Future Consideration

If detailed technical documentation is needed in the future, this content can be referenced and potentially re-integrated in a simpler form.
