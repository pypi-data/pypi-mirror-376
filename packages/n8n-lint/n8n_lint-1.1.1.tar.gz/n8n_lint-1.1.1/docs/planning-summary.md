# Mono Package & PyPI Deployment - Planning Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Task:** Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)  
**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Creative Phase

---

## üéØ **PLANNING OVERVIEW**

### Task Scope

Convert n8n-lint from a single package to a mono package architecture, implement automated PyPI deployment, and execute a comprehensive documentation overhaul.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Level**: 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- **Scope**: Major architectural change with deployment and documentation components
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High (PyPI deployment, package restructuring)
- **Estimated Effort**: 5 weeks (significant package structure, CI/CD updates, documentation rewrite)

---

## üìã **REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY**

### Core Requirements

1. **Mono Package Structure** - Convert to organized sub-packages
2. **PyPI Deployment** - Automated deployment with semantic versioning
3. **Documentation Overhaul** - Modern, comprehensive documentation
4. **CI/CD Enhancement** - Updated GitHub Actions for PyPI deployment
5. **Version Management** - Automated release process
6. **Package Distribution** - Multiple distribution formats

### Technical Constraints

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI
- Preserve Python 3.12+ support
- Leverage existing UV toolchain
- Maintain 88%+ test coverage
- Follow streamlined documentation approach

## üèóÔ∏è **COMPONENT ANALYSIS**

### High Impact Components

1. **Package Structure (src/n8n_lint/)** - Core architecture change
2. **Configuration (pyproject.toml)** - Build and distribution configuration
3. **CI/CD Pipeline (.github/workflows/)** - Deployment automation
4. **Documentation (docs/, README.md)** - User experience and adoption

### Medium Impact Components

5. **Testing Infrastructure (tests/)** - Test compatibility updates

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

**Planning Phase Complete** ‚úÖ

**Required Next Action**: Switch to **CREATIVE MODE** for design decisions

The comprehensive planning phase has identified three critical creative phases that require design decisions before implementation can begin:

1. **Architecture Design** - Mono package structure and import strategy
2. **Documentation Design** - Information architecture and user experience
3. **Deployment Design** - Release strategy and security architecture

**Type 'CREATIVE' to begin the design decision phase**
