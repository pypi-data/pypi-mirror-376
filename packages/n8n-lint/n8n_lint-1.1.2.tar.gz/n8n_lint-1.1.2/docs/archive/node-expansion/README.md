# Node Expansion Archive

This directory contains the node expansion planning that was archived to keep the n8n-lint tool simple and focused.

## Archived Files

- `node-expansion-plan.md` - Comprehensive node coverage strategy

## What Was Removed

- Extensive node coverage plans
- Complex schema management strategies
- Automated update workflows
- Community contribution frameworks

## Why It Was Archived

The node expansion planning added complexity beyond what's needed for a simple CLI tool:

1. **Feature Creep** - Moved beyond core validation functionality
2. **Over-Planning** - Too much planning for a simple tool
3. **Complexity** - Added unnecessary complexity to the project
4. **Maintenance Burden** - Would require ongoing maintenance and updates

## Current Approach

The tool now focuses on:

- Core validation functionality
- Essential node types only
- Simple schema management
- Basic validation rules

## Future Consideration

If extensive node coverage is needed in the future, this planning can be referenced and potentially re-integrated in a simpler form.
