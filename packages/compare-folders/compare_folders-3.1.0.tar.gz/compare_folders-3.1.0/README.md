## Installation

It is recommended to install using `pipx`, but you can also use `pip`. See <https://pypi.org/project/pipx/>.

```sh
pipx install compare-folders
```

## Usage

`compare-folders path\to\source path\to\destination`

This will write a markdown file with:

- missing files from the source not in the destination
- extra files in the destination not in the source
- files in both locations with different modification dates

It will also print a table of stats.

Use `-o`/`--output` to override the output filename. If the output file already exists, the resulsts will be appended to the file, unless you specify `--no-append`, in which case the file will be overwritten.
