fixes:
  - |
    Restore the default Let's Encrypt ACME server for external certificates
    so that enabling ``enable_letsencrypt`` works out of the box again
    without explicitly setting ``letsencrypt_external_cert_server``. The
    default is ``https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Deployments using a file-based external certificate and Let's Encrypt for
    the internal certificate (separate VIPs) default to managing the external
    certificate with Let's Encrypt. To retain a file-based external
    certificate, set ``letsencrypt_external_cert_server: ""``.
