    Prevents accidental ``libvirt`` downgrades in ``nova_libvirt`` container
    image during deploy and upgrade. Adds a ``nova_libvirt`` version check that
    resolves the target image digest once on the first compute host
    and runs only on hypervisors where the running container digest differs
    from the target.
