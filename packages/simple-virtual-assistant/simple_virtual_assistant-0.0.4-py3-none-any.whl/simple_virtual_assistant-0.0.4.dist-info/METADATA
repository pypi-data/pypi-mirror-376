# Description
`simplevirtual-assistant` is an extremely simple Python module that allows one to create their own voice assistants, using the transcription ability of `faster-whisper`, the messaging ability of a configurable LLM, and the tooling ability of `langchain`.

## Caveat

This is not meant for large projects. I primarily wrote it to use in my [frame-assist](https://github.com/atmaranto/frame-assist) package.

## Compatbility

Tested on Debian Linux and Windows 10.

## Example

[main.py](main.py) contains a fairly simple example of an Ollama-powered large language model chatbot that answers user questions.

**Requirements**:
- Ollama with the `--model` you specify already pulled (defaults to `qwen3:8b`)
- `ffmpeg` (on Windows) for voice recording
- `arecord` (on Linux) for voice recording

#### Usage

```bash
python -m venv virtual-assistant-venv
source virtual-assistant-venv/bin/activate 
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
