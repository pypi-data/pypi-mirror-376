> [!IMPORTANT]
> The implementation differs from the formula presented in the article!
> 
> **Statement on the website of the online calculator:**
> <br>
> From 18 September 2013, the integer score will increase by 2 if heart failure was diagnosed > 18 months ago.
> This may affect a comparison of the current result to risk assessments before this date.

Calculator returns integer risk score, can be used to look up 1- and 3-year risk of death for patients with heart failure (HF)

### Testing
For automated testing against the R implementation and online/Excel calculators (if available) of these scores,
clone the R project and follow the instructions there (https://github.com/IMI-HD/acribis_scores_r).
Run the R Shiny app locally on port 80 and keep it running while executing the tests:

```Shell
# In the acribis_scores_r folder
shiny::runApp("app/demo_gui.R", port=80)
```

Install the package with additional optional dependencies and run the tests:

```Shell
# Install with optional test dependencies
pip install acribis-scores[test]
```

**Windows**
```Shell
# In the acribis_scores_python folder
py -m unittest discover tests
```

**Linux**
```Shell
# In the acribis_scores_python folder
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
