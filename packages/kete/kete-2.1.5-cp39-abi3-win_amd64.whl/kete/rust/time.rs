/// A representation of time, always in JD with TDB scaling.
///
/// Note that TDB is not the same as UTC, there is often about 60 seconds or more
/// offset between these time formats. This class enables fast conversion to and from
/// UTC however, via the :py:meth:`~Time.from_mjd`, and :py:meth:`~Time.from_iso`.
/// UTC can be recovered from this object through :py:meth:`~Time.utc_mjd`,
/// :py:meth:`~Time.utc_jd`, or :py:meth:`~Time.iso`.
///
/// Future UTC Leap seconds cannot be predicted, as a result of this, UTC becomes a
/// bit fuzzy when attempting to represent future times. All conversion of future times
/// therefore ignores the possibility of leap seconds.
///
/// This representation and conversion tools make some small tradeoff for performance
/// vs accuracy. Conversion between time scales is only accurate on the millisecond
/// scale, however internal representation accuracy is on the microsecond scale.
///
/// TDB is treated as equivalent to TT and TCB, because these times only differ by less
/// than milliseconds per century.
///
/// Parameters
/// ----------
/// jd:
///     Julian Date in days.
/// scaling:
///     Accepts 'tdb', 'tai', 'utc', 'tcb', and 'tt', but they are converted to TDB
///     immediately. Defaults to 'tdb'
