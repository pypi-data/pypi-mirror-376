**collective.html2blocks** is an open-source Python package designed to facilitate the migration of content from legacy {term}`Plone` sites and other {term}`CMS`s to {term}`Volto`. It provides robust tools for converting HTML content into Volto blocks, making it easier to modernize and restructure existing websites without manual reformatting.

The package offers a flexible registry and converter system for parsing HTML, handling complex content structures, and generating Volto-compatible JSON. It supports CLI and REST API, enabling batch processing, automation, and integration into existing migration workflows. With `collective.html2blocks`, developers can streamline migrations, preserve rich content, and take advantage of Volto's block-based editing experience.
