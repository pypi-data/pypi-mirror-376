"""
Test for the version preservation fix in ask_input.py.

This test ensures that command-line provided parameters (like version)
are preserved throughout the interactive flow when ask_missing_params is called.

Regression test for the bug where:
1. User specifies --version v1.26.0 on command line
2. Version gets correctly added to answers dict: {"versions": ["v1.26.0"]}
3. When inquirer.prompt() is called for interactive board selection,
   it replaces the entire answers dict
4. The returned dict only contains interactive responses, losing pre-existing version information
