features:
  - |
    If `allow_image_access_via_auth_token` is set to `True`, Ironic allows access to
    Glance images if an auth_token is present in the request context.
upgrade:
  - |
    CONF.allow_image_access_via_auth_token is set to `True` in this Ironic release.
    OpenStack integrated operators should ensure images for Ironic use are using image
    visibility "public" or "community" for the most reliable results.
deprecation:
  - |
    CONF.allow_image_access_via_auth_token is deprecated, and will be removed,
    along with legacy image access logic, in or after the OpenStack 2026.2 release.
