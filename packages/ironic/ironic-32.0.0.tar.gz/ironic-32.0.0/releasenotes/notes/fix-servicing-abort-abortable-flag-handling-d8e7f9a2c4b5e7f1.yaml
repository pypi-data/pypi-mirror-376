    Fixes servicing abort handling to respect the `abortable` flag of service steps.
    Previously, servicing steps could be aborted regardless of their `abortable` flag
    setting. Now, if a service step has `abortable` set to `False`, the abort will
    be deferred until the current step completes, similar to how cleaning steps work.
    This ensures service steps that cannot be safely interrupted are allowed to complete
    before the abort takes effect.
