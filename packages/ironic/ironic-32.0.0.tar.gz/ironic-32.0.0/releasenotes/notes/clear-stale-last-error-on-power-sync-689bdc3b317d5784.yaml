    When power state synchronization confirms or restores the expected state,
    the ``last_error`` field may retain stale messages, giving a misleading
    impression of failure on an otherwise healthy node. If
    ``[conductor]node_history`` is enabled, the field is now cleared,
    ensuring status reflects current node health while preserving error
    history.
