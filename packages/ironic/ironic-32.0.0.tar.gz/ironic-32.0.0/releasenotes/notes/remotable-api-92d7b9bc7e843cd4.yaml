features:
  - |
    Adds the capability for the Ironic API services to operate without
    a direct connection to the Ironic database backend. Instead the
    RPC Object model through the concept of remotable objects.
    The ``[default]use_rpc_for_database`` setting can be utilized to
    leverage this mode of operation, however it is also implied when
    the ``[default]rpc_transport`` option is set to ``none`` or ``local``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The introduction of the capability to utilize remotable objects with
    the API has resulted in object versions internally being incremented
    without actual schema changes. This may result in an upgrade taking
    a little longer, depending on the size of the database,
    as object versions are updated during the upgrade sequence.
deprecations:
  - |
    Use of the API DBHook feature, i.e. the resulting ``api.request.dbapi``
    pattern in API service code is deprecated and the DBHook will be removed
    in a future release of Ironic. Any downstream maintainers which utilize
    this pattern are encouraged to utilize an object to serve as an
    intermediary stepping stone between the API and the database.
