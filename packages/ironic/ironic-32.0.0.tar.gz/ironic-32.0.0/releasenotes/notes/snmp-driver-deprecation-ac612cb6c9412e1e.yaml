deprecations:
  - |
    The SNMP hardware type and associated interfaces have been deprecated
    for removal in a future Ironic release. It currently depends on an
    outdated, unsupported library and unless it is migrated off that library
    by the end of the 2026.1 cycle it will be removed.

    Operators utilizing this driver will need to find an alternate way
    to manage their machines. Alternatively, the Ironic community welcomes
    contributions to keep this driver alive.
