fixes:
  - |
    No longer uses JSON RPC with ``[DEFAULT]rpc_transport`` set to ``none``.
    It was required during the transition away from eventlet, and is no longer
    needed. RPC can still be enabled by setting ``rpc_transport`` to
    ``json-rpc``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The options in the ``[local_rpc]`` group introduced in Ironic 31.0 have
    been removed and no longer have any effect.
