    Added a new 'api-call' action plugin for Ironic inspection rules.

    This action allows triggering an HTTP GET request to a given URL when a
    rule matches successfully during node inspection. It is useful for
    integrating with external systems such as webhooks, alerting, or
    automation tools.

    The following options are supported:

    * url (required): The HTTP endpoint to call
    * timeout (optional, default: 5): Timeout in seconds
    * retries (optional, default: 3): Number of retries on failure
    * backoff_factor (optional, default: 0.3): Delay factor for retry attempts
    * headers, proxies (optional): Additional request configuration

    Retry applies to status codes 429, 500, 502, 503, and 504.

    Example rule::

      [
        {
          "description": "Trigger webhook after node inspection",
          "actions": [
            {
              "action": "api-call",
              "url": "http://example.com/hook",
              "timeout": 10,
              "retries": 5,
              "backoff_factor": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
