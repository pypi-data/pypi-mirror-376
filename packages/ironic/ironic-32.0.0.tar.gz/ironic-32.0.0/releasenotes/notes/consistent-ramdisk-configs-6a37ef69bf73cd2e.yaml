    Added a new configuration option
    ``[conductor]error_on_ramdisk_config_inconsistency`` to control how Ironic
    handles inconsistent kernel and ramdisk configurations.

    When ``error_on_ramdisk_config_inconsistency`` is set to ``True``, Ironic
    will raise a ``MissingParameterValue`` exception when it encounters
    inconsistent kernel/ramdisk configurations, such as:

    * A node's ``driver_info`` containing only ``deploy_kernel`` but missing
      ``deploy_ramdisk`` (or vice versa)
    * The ``[conductor]deploy_kernel_by_arch`` configuration having entries for
      architectures that are missing from ``[conductor]deploy_ramdisk_by_arch``
      (or vice versa)
    * Similar inconsistencies with rescue kernel/ramdisk configurations

    When set to ``False`` (the default), Ironic will log warning messages about
    these inconsistencies but continue operation by falling back to global
    configuration values when possible.

    In a future Ironic release, the default of this value will be changed to
    True to enforce strict validation.

    The new ``[conductor]error_on_ramdisk_config_inconsistency`` configuration
    option defaults to ``False`` to maintain backward compatibility. Existing
    deployments with inconsistent kernel/ramdisk configurations will continue
    to work as before, with warning messages logged to help identify potential
    configuration issues.

    Operators who want strict validation of kernel/ramdisk configurations can
    set this option to ``True``, but should first review their configurations
    to ensure consistency across all node ``driver_info`` entries and
    architecture-specific configuration options. Ironic expects to enable
    strict validation of these values in a future release.
