    Fixes an issue where a Nova, or other consumer attempting to send network
    data to Ironic can send invalid network metadata which needs to
    be replaced. Ironic now identifies the condition, and regenerates the network
    metadata utilizing the attached VIF records. This results in some minor
    data differences, such as Nova's internal VIF tap naming which is redundant,
    and MTUs to be included in the Network data when they might not have been
    included previously. More information about this bug can be found in
    bug `2106073 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2106073>`_. This logic
    does *not* attempt to patch or modify configuration drive URLs which are
    supplied by tools like Bifrost, which is unaffected by this issue.
    This fix can be disabled by setting ``[conductor]disable_configdrive_check``
    to ``True``.
