    Adds two new capabilities to the Redfish managemnet interface
    for managing the BMC clock.

    1. A manual cleaning step ``set_bmc_clock`` that allows operators
       to set the BMC's hardware clock to a specific datetime (in ISO8601 format),
       optionally including a datetimelocaloffset.

    2. An automated verify step ``verify_bmc_clock``  that compares the
       BMC's Redfish datetime to the system UTC time, and automatically
       updates the BMC clock if needed. Verification fails if the difference
       exceeds 1 second after the update.

    These steps helps ensure BMC clock synchronization in baremetal environments
    where incorrect or drifting BMC clocks may lead to TLS  certificate validation failures.
