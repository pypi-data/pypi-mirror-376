    The Ironic developers are proud to announce our release for the 2025.2
    development cycle in the form of Ironic 32.0.0. This release brings
    substantial changes in Ironic which will improve the experience and
    performance of Ironic. Amongst these herculian efforts includes the
    removal of Eventlet, Database Object Indirection, Redfish inspection
    use of inspection rules and hooks. Along with numerous bug fixes
    to address operator feedback to ultimately improve the user experience.
    All of this work is on top of our previously released 31.0.0 and 30.0.0
    releases which were performed as part of this development cycle.
