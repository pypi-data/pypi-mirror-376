    Fixes an issue where a "null" or missing MTU value for network_data.json
    payloads in configuration drives forces a regeneration of the configuration
    drive. This behavior is enabled by default, and can be disabled by using the
    ``[conductor]disable_metadata_mtu_check`` configuration option by setting the
    option value to ``True``.
