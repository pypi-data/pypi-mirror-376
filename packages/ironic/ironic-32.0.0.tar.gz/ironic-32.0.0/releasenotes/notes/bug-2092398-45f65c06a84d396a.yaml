    [`Bug 2092398 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2092398>`_]
    Fixes an issue with node servicing/cleaning that caused the node to enter
    into `service failed` or `clean failed` state after doing a bmc firmware
    update, due to the BMC being unresponsive to requests during the update.
    Now when doing a BMC update, we wait some time before proceeding with the
    reboot to finish the update.
    The time is configurable and can be changed via the config option
    ``[redfish]firmware_update_wait_unresponsive_bmc`` (default, 300 seconds)
    or by setting ``firmware_update_unresponsive_bmc_wait`` in the
    ``driver-info``.
