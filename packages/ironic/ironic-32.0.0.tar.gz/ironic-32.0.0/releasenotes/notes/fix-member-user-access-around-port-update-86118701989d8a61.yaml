    Fixes an issue with the ``neutron`` ``network_interface`` driver where
    validate calls by ``member`` scoped API users, triggered through a port
    update or explicit node interface validation action would fail due to
    the user being unable to resolve provisioning or cleaning networks
    because the networks are in a different project.
