    While never supported outside of the Ironic project's CI testing, use of
    the TinyIPA ramdisk image is in the process of being discontinued. Any
    users who chose to utilize TinyIPA for any reasons should leverage
    ironic-python-agent-builder images.

    Ironic is in the process of removing testing and use of TinyIPA, which was
    originally developed as a lightweight low memory IPA image to simplify
    upstream testing and had no use outside of that context. Due to the
    OpenStack move away from Python3.9, TinyIPA cannot continue
    to be maintained, and as such all testing and use of images will be
    discontinued by the Ironic community.
