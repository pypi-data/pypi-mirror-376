    Fixes bug where reserved service steps (wait, hold) executed on nodes in
    "service failed" state would incorrectly transition the node directly to
    "active" state, bypassing the expected intermediate wait/hold states.
    Now nodes in "service failed" state properly transition to "service wait"
    or "service hold" when wait/hold steps are executed, maintaining the
    expected state machine flow.
