    Start and end of dynamic step-based flows (automated cleaning,
    manual cleaning, servicing, and deploy steps) are now logged to
    Node History if ``[conductor]record_step_flows_in_history`` is enabled
    (default: ``True``). This makes it easier to trace what steps were
    attempted when troubleshooting deployment failures.

    A second knob which is disabled by default,
    ``[conductor]log_step_flows_to_syslog``, allows emitting the same flow
    events, but to the service log.
