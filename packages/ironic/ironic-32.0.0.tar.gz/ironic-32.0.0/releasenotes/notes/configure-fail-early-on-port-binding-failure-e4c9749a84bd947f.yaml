    Adds a new boolean configuration option ``[neutron]fail_on_port_binding_failure``
    and corresponding node ``driver_info`` setting ``fail_on_binding_failure``
    to control whether deployment should fail or continue if Neutron port
    binding fails. With a default of ``true``, if your network is not
    configured properly, this will likely cause deployment failures.
    To maintain the previous behavior, explicitly set this option to False in
    your configuration.
