upgrade:
  - |
    The ``wsgi_scripts`` entry point ``ironic-api-wsgi`` has been removed
    from ``setup.cfg``. WSGI servers should now use the module path
    ``ironic.wsgi:application`` directly instead of the generated script.
    This change aligns with the OpenStack goal to migrate from WSGI scripts
    to module paths and is compatible with modern Python packaging tools.

    For example, with gunicorn::

        gunicorn ironic.wsgi:application

    Or with uwsgi::

        [uwsgi]
        module = ironic.wsgi:application
  - |
    The Apache mod_wsgi sample configuration has been removed. Operators
    should use modern WSGI servers like uWSGI or Gunicorn instead, which
    provide better performance and are simpler to configure. See the
    updated deployment documentation for examples.
deprecations:
  - |
    While the legacy ``ironic.api.wsgi:initialize_wsgi_app()`` function
    remains available for backward compatibility, new deployments should
    use ``ironic.wsgi:application`` instead.
