    Fixes interface binding logic as it relates to Neutron VIF attachments,
    such that an initial neutron port update occurs to ensure Neutron performs
    any necessary address assignments, which will now result in the port
    entering an ``ACTIVE`` state. The state may change later on as the port
    is updated as part of any workflow actions with supplied port configuration
    information to allow ML2 plugins to finalize any port binding actions, when
    appropriate. The base bug which identified this issue is
    `bug 2106073 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2106073>`_, which will
    require additional work to completely fix.

    Related, this logic *also* detaches any previously bound VIF which might
    have been supplied to Ironic. To have done so in advance of attachment is
    erroneous, yet understandable behavior.
