fixes:
  - |
    The Ironic REST API and JSON-RPC endpoints are now served by
    ``cheroot.wsgi.Server`` instead of the deprecated ``oslo_service.wsgi``
    / eventlet stack.  Behaviour and CLI commands are unchanged.

features:
  - |
    The REST API and JSON-RPC listeners now honour new options in their own
    config sections:

    * ``[api]cert_file`` / ``[api]key_file``
    * ``[json_rpc]cert_file`` / ``[json_rpc]key_file``

    This lets operators present different certificates for each endpoint
    without touching the global ``[ssl]`` block as that is now deprecated,
    to be removed in **2026.1**.

    Deployments that still rely on the global ``[ssl]`` section are advised
    to move the certificate settings to the per-service options.
