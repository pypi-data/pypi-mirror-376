    The ``ipmitool-socat`` console interface is now available for users of the
    ``redfish`` hardware type. This was done as an enablement action for
    operators to be able to leverage IPMI based Serial-over-Lan connections.
    This option requires the IPMI parameters to be configured on the baremetal
    node in addition to the ``redfish`` hardware type.
