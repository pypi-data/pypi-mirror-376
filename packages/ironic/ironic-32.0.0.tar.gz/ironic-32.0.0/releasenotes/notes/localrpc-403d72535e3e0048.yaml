upgrade:
  - |
    All-in-one Ironic processes that use ``rpc_transport=none`` are switched
    to using JSON RPC over localhost on upgrade. This is because the current
    model is not compatible with the post-eventlet architecture.

    Make sure that local traffic is possible on port 8089. If not, you may
    change the port by modifying the ``[json_rpc]port`` option.
