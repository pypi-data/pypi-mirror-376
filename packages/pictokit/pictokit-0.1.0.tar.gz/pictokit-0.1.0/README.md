# pictokit

## Introduction

`pictokit` is a Python library designed to perform **image processing and transformations**.  
It serves as a foundation for applying different methods commonly studied in **Image Processing courses**, while also being flexible enough to be extended for research and development.

---

## Installation

`pictokit` requires **Python >= 3.10**.

You can install it directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pictokit
```

---

## Features

- Basic image loading and visualization  
- Color space conversions  
- Filtering and edge detection  
- Geometric transformations  
- Histogram analysis and equalization  
- [More features will be added and documented here in future versions]

## How it Works

The library provides modular functions that can be combined to build **image transformation pipelines**.  
It is meant to be lightweight and educational, focusing on clarity and usability.  
Detailed usage examples will be provided in the official documentation.  

---

## Academic Motivation

This project was created in the context of **Image Processing courses**, to consolidate theoretical knowledge through practical implementations.  
It aims to provide both a **learning resource for students** and a **useful toolkit for developers** who want to explore image transformations.
