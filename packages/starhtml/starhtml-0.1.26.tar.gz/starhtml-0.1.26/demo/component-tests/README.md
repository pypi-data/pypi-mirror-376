# Component Test Files

This directory contains test harnesses for verifying component and handler behavior during development.

## Purpose
- Test handler implementations with real component patterns
- Verify visual behavior and interactions
- Serve as examples of component usage patterns

## Files
- `test_position_opacity.py` - Tests the position handler's opacity-based hiding to prevent flash/jump effects

## Usage
Run test files directly with Python:
```bash
uv run demo/component-tests/test_position_opacity.py
```

These files are temporary development aids that may evolve into formal examples or be replaced as the component library matures.
