# Why Use a Graph?

Traditional documentation is often structured as a linear sequence of pages. While this is suitable for some purposes, it can make it difficult to see the relationships between different pieces of information.

A graph visualization, on the other hand, allows you to see your documentation as a network of interconnected ideas. This has several advantages:

- **Improved Discoverability:** By visualizing the connections between pages, you can more easily discover related content that you might not have found otherwise.
- **Better Understanding:** Seeing the "big picture" can help you to understand the overall structure of your documentation and how different topics relate to one another.
- **Enhanced Navigation:** The graph provides a powerful and intuitive way to navigate your documentation, allowing you to jump between related topics with ease.
