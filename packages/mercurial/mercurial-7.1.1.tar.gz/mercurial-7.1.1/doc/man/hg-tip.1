The tip revision (usually just called the tip) is the changeset
most recently added to the repository (and therefore the most
recently changed head).
.sp
If you have just made a commit, that commit will be the tip. If
you have just pulled changes from another repository, the tip of
that repository becomes the current tip. The "tip" tag is special
and cannot be renamed or assigned to a different changeset.
