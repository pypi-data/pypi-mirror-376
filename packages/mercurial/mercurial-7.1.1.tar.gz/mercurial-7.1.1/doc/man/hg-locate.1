.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory whose
names match the given patterns.
.sp
By default, this command searches all directories in the working
directory. To search just the current directory and its
subdirectories, use "\-\-include .".
.sp
If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names
of all files under Mercurial control in the working directory.
.sp
If you want to feed the output of this command into the "xargs"
command, use the \-0 option to both this command and "xargs". This
will avoid the problem of "xargs" treating single filenames that
contain whitespace as multiple filenames.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help files\fP\: for a more versatile command.
.sp
Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.
