LDLTMgr (LDLT Manager)

This code defines a class called LDLTMgr, which stands for LDLT Manager. The purpose of this class is to perform a special kind of matrix factorization called LDLT factorization on symmetric matrices. This factorization is useful in various mathematical and engineering applications, especially when dealing with linear systems and eigenvalue problems.

The main input for this class is a symmetric matrix, which can be provided either as a NumPy array or through a function that returns individual matrix elements. The primary output is a boolean value indicating whether the input matrix is positive definite (a special property of matrices). Additionally, the class can produce other outputs like a witness vector (if the matrix is not positive definite) and a square root of the matrix (if it is positive definite).

The LDLTMgr class achieves its purpose through several methods. The main method is 'factor', which performs the actual LDLT factorization. It does this by going through the matrix elements row by row, calculating and storing values in a special way. This process helps determine if the matrix is positive definite and allows for efficient calculations later.

An important aspect of this code is its use of "lazy evaluation". This means it doesn't need the entire matrix upfront but can work with just a function that provides matrix elements as needed. This can be more efficient for large matrices or when the matrix is defined by a formula rather than stored values.

The class also includes methods to check if the matrix is positive definite ('is_spd'), calculate a witness vector if it's not ('witness'), and compute a symmetric quadratic form ('sym_quad'). These additional functionalities make the class versatile for various matrix-related tasks.

One of the key transformations happening in this code is the factorization itself. It's breaking down the original matrix into simpler parts (L, D, and L transpose), which can be used to solve problems more easily. This factorization is done in a way that avoids using square roots, which can be computationally expensive.

Overall, the LDLTMgr class provides a set of tools for working with symmetric matrices, with a focus on determining their properties (like positive definiteness) and performing useful calculations efficiently. It's designed to be flexible and can handle both standard matrices and those defined by functions, making it useful in a variety of mathematical and engineering contexts.

class LDLTMgr:
    """LDLT factorization (mainly for LMI oracles)

    `LDLTMgr` is a class that performs the LDLT factorization for a given
    symmetric matrix. The LDLT factorization decomposes a symmetric matrix A into
    the product of a lower triangular matrix L, a diagonal matrix D, and the
    transpose of L. This factorization is useful for solving linear systems and
    eigenvalue problems. The class provides methods to perform the factorization,
    check if the matrix is positive definite, calculate a witness vector if it is
    not positive definite, and calculate the symmetric quadratic form.

    - LDL^T square-root-free version
    - Option allow semidefinite
    - Cholesky-Banachiewicz style, row-based
    - Lazy evaluation
    - A matrix A in R^{m x m} is positive definite
                         iff v^T A v > 0 for all v in R^n.
