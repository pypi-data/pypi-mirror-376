def by_condition_number(sensors_to_keep, shape_matrix, return_condition_numbers=False):
    '''Get the best set of degrees of freedom by mode shape condition number

    This function accepts a shape matrix and returns the set of degrees of
    freedom that corresponds to the lowest condition number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sensors_to_keep : int
        The number of sensors to keep.
    shape_matrix : np.ndarray
        A 2D or 3D numpy array.  If it is a 2D array, the row indices should
        correspond to the degree of freedom and the column indices should
        correspond to the mode.  For a 3D array, the first index corresponds to
        a "bundle" of channels (e.g. a triaxial accelerometer) that must be
        kept or removed as one unit.
    return_condition_numbers : bool (default False)
        If True, return a second value that is the condition number at each
        iteration of the technique.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : np.array
        A 1d array corresponding to the indices to keep in the first dimension
        of the shape_matrix array (e.g. new_shape_matrix =
        shape_matrix[incies,...])
    returned_condition_numbers : list
        The condition number at each iteration.  Returned only if
        return_condition_numbers is True.
