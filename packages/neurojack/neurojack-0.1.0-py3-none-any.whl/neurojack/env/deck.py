class Deck:
    """
    Represents one or more combined decks of playing cards for Blackjack.

    This class manages:
    - Creating a specified number of standard decks.
    - Shuffling cards.
    - Dealing cards one at a time.
    - Automatically reshuffling when the remaining cards fall below a threshold.

    Attributes:
        num_decks (int): Number of 52-card decks in use.
        initial_num_cards (int): Total cards at the start.
        reshuffle_threshold (int): The card count at which the deck reshuffles.
        cards (List[Card]): The current list of cards in the deck.
        seed (Optional[int]): Random seed for reproducible shuffling.
