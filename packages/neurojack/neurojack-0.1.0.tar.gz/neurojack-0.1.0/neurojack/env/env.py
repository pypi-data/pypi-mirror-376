# blackjack_rl/env/env.py
"""
This module implements a custom, highly configurable Blackjack environment.
It does not rely on the standard Gymnasium library, allowing for tailored
rules, such as card counting, doubling down, and splitting.

The environment simulates a game of Blackjack between a single player and a
dealer. It provides a state representation suitable for reinforcement learning
agents and handles all game mechanics, including card dealing, hand evaluation,
player actions, and reward calculation.
