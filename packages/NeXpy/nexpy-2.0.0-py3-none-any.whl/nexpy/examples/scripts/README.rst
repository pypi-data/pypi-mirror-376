About these example scripts
---------------------------

These files are examples of scripts that can be run from the script editor
within NeXpy. If they are copied to ~/.nexpy/scripts, they can be opened 
directly from the Scripts Menu.

**example.py**

A simple script to create a NeXus tree containing a two-dimensional function
of NumPy arrays. A similar example is given in the NeXpy documentation.

**chopper_plot.py**

A script to plot a sequence of cuts, displaced along the y-axis. It assumes 
that ``chopper.nxs``, which is one of the example files, has been loaded.
