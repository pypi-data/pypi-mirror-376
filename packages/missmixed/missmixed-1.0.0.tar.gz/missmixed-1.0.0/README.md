# MissMixed

## A Configurable Framework for Iterative Missing Data Imputation

**MissMixed** is a Python library designed for flexible and modular imputation of missing values in tabular datasets. It supports a wide range of imputation strategies, including ensemble methods, trial-based model selection, and deep learning integration — all within a customizable iterative architecture.

## 🔍 What is MissMixed?

MissMixed is not just a single algorithm — it’s a **framework** for building **iteration-wise, model-aware imputation pipelines**. It enables users to:

- Handle continuous, categorical, or mixed-type features
- Define custom model configurations at each iteration
- Combine multiple imputation algorithms (e.g., RandomForest, KNN, Deep Neural Networks)
- Dynamically evaluate and update imputed values using internal validation

Whether you’re working with low-dimensional medical data or large-scale mixed-type datasets, MissMixed is designed to offer **accuracy**, **adaptability**, and **interpretability**.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
pip install missmixed
```
