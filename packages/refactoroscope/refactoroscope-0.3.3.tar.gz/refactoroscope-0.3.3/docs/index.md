# Refactoroscope Documentation

Welcome to the Refactoroscope documentation!

A Python-based command-line tool that provides comprehensive analysis of source code repositories. Think of it as an **MRI scanner for your codebase** - it doesn't just show you what's there, but reveals the health and complexity of your code structure.

## Features

- Scans directories recursively for source code files
- Respects `.gitignore` patterns at all directory levels
- Counts lines of code per file
- Displays file sizes in human-readable format
- Sorts results by line count
- Beautiful terminal output using Rich
- Code complexity analysis (Cyclomatic, Cognitive, Halstead)
- Duplicate code detection using AST-based analysis
- **Unused code detection using AST-based analysis**
- **Unused file detection using dependency graph analysis**
- **AI-powered code quality suggestions**
- Export results to JSON/CSV/HTML
- Configuration file support (.refactoroscope.yml)
- Multi-language support (60+ programming languages)
- Performance optimizations with parallel processing
- CI/CD integration support (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Real-time file watching for live code analysis
- Advanced AST-based duplicate code detection with clone type classification

## Installation

First, install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

```bash
uv run refactoroscope analyze .
uv run refactoroscope analyze . --complexity
uv run refactoroscope analyze . --export json,html --export-dir ./reports
```
