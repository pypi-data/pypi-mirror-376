**ONAD** is a comprehensive Python toolkit for **Online Anomaly Detection**, designed for real-time streaming data analysis. It provides state-of-the-art algorithms and utilities for detecting anomalies in continuous data streams with minimal latency and memory footprint.

## 🚀 Key Features

### **Streaming-First Design**
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Designed for constant memory usage regardless of stream length
- **Real-time Processing**: Process data points as they arrive with minimal latency
- **Incremental Learning**: Models adapt and learn from new data without full retraining

### **Comprehensive Algorithm Library**
- **Forest-based Models**: Online Isolation Forest, Mondrian Forest
- **SVM-based Models**: Adaptive SVM, GADGET SVM with graph structures
- **Statistical Models**: Moving averages, covariance analysis, Mahalanobis distance
- **Distance-based Models**: K-Nearest Neighbors, similarity search engines

### **Flexible Pipeline System**
- **Modular Architecture**: Compose complex detection pipelines from simple components
- **Data Transformers**: Built-in scaling, PCA, and preprocessing utilities
- **Stream Processing**: Efficient data streaming with configurable batch processing

### **Production-Ready**
- **Memory Management**: Configurable memory limits and automatic cleanup
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and graceful failure recovery
- **Extensive Logging**: Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support and code reliability

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **IoT Sensor Monitoring**: Detect anomalies in sensor readings from industrial equipment
- **Network Security**: Identify unusual network traffic patterns and potential threats
- **Financial Fraud Detection**: Monitor transactions for fraudulent activities
- **System Monitoring**: Detect performance anomalies in server metrics
- **Quality Control**: Identify defective products in manufacturing processes

## 📦 Quick Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install onad

# With evaluation tools
pip install onad[eval]

# With deep learning support
pip install onad[dl]

# Full installation with all features
pip install onad[all]
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from onad.model.iforest import OnlineIsolationForest
from onad.stream import ParquetStreamer, Dataset

# Initialize the model
model = OnlineIsolationForest(
    num_trees=100,
    window_size=1000,
    max_leaf_samples=32
)

# Stream data and detect anomalies
with ParquetStreamer(Dataset.FRAUD) as streamer:
    for features, label in streamer:
        # Learn from the data point
        model.learn_one(features)

        # Get anomaly score
        score = model.score_one(features)

        # Check if it's an anomaly
        if score > 0.7:  # threshold
            print(f"Anomaly detected! Score: {score:.3f}")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
