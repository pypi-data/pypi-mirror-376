class KNN(BaseModel):
    """
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for similarity-based machine learning.

    This class implements a KNN algorithm that relies on a similarity search engine
    to find the nearest neighbors of a given data point. It inherits from `BaseModel`
    and is designed to work with feature vectors represented as dictionaries.

    Attributes:
        k (int): The number of nearest neighbors to consider.
        engine (BaseSimilaritySearchEngine): The similarity search engine used to find neighbors.
    """

        Initializes the KNN model with the specified number of neighbors and similarity engine.

        Args:
            k (int): The number of nearest neighbors to consider. Must be positive.
            similarity_engine (BaseSimilaritySearchEngine): An instance of a similarity search engine
                that will be used to compute nearest neighbors.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If k is not a positive integer.

        Adds a new data point to the model for future similarity searches.

        Args:
            x (Dict[str, float]): A dictionary representing a data point, where keys are feature names
                and values are feature values.

        Computes a score for the given data point based on its nearest neighbors.

        Args:
            x (Dict[str, float]): A dictionary representing a data point, where keys are feature names
                and values are feature values.

        Returns:
            float: A score representing the similarity of the data point to its nearest neighbors.
                The exact interpretation of the score (distance, similarity, etc.) depends on the
                underlying similarity engine implementation.
