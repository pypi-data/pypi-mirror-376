## Examples

### Adding a New Web Command

## Notes

- The app uses Google's speech recognition service, so an internet connection is required
- For volume control commands, you may need to install nircmd (optional)
- Speak clearly and wait for the app to process your command before giving the next one
- Say "help" to hear the available commands
- Press Ctrl+C to force quit the application

## Troubleshooting

- If you get audio-related errors, make sure your microphone is working and properly configured
- If speech recognition isn't working, check your internet connection
- The app adjusts for ambient noise when it starts, so wait for the ready message before speaking

## Security Note

This app can execute system commands like shutdown and restart. Use with caution and only run commands you understand.
