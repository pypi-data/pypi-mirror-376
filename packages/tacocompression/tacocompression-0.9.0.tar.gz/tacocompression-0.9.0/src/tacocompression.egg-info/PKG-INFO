# taco-compression
This is the official implementation of the TACO compression algorithm for time series [1]. 

# Usage
There are two usage modes, one as a command line tool operating on files, the other as callables from within python.

## Command Line
```shell
python -m taco-compress "time_series"
```

```shell
python -m taco-compress "data/time_series_1.csv"
```

## As a Callable
```python
import taco-compress

taco-compress.
```
