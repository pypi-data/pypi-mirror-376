def fetch(dataset=None, clear_cache=False, download_all=False)->dict:

    Args:
        dataset (str, optional): name of the dataset. See below for options.
        clear_cache (bool, optional): When a dataset is fetched, it is 
          downloaded and then stored in a local cache memory for faster access 
          next time it is fetched. Set clear_cache=True to delete all data 
          in the cache memory. Default is False.
        download_all (bool, optional): By default only the dataset that is 
          fetched is downloaded. Set download_all=True to download all 
          datasets at once. This will cost some time but then offers fast and 
          offline access to all datasets afterwards. This will take up around 
          300 MB of space on your hard drive. Default is False.

    Returns:
        dict: Data as a dictionary. 

    Example:
        Fetch the MOLLI images, and display as animation:

        :include-source:
        :context: 

        >>> import mdreg

    Notes:

        The following datasets can be fetched: 
        
        **MOLLI**

            **Size**: 2MB

            **Background**: T1-mapping data for the kidney acquired on a 
            healthy volunteer, collected as part of the technical validation 
            efforts of the 
            `UKRIN-MAPS consortium <https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/spmic/research/uk-renal-imaging-network/ukrin-maps.aspx>`_ 
            and the development of the 
            `UKAT package <https://github.com/UKRIN-MAPS/ukat>`_.

            **Data format**: The fetch function returns a dictionary, which 
            contains the following items: 
            
            - **array**: 4D array of signal intensities in the abdomen at 
              different inversion times.
            - **TI**: A list of inversion times in msec.

            Funding statement:

            Data collection was funded by the UKRIN-MAPS MRC Partnership 
            grant (MR/R02264X/1) and the NIHR AFiRM project (NIHR128494).

        **MOLLI_small**

            **Size**: 129KB

            **Background**: A small version of 'MOLLI' dataset, in 4x lower 
            resolution than the original. Useful for rapid testing and 
            debugging on a local machine. 

        **MOLLI_tiny**

            **Size**: 9KB

            **Background**: A tiny version of 'MOLLI' dataset, in 16x lower 
            resolution than the original. Useful for testing and debugging 
            solutions on remote machines.  

        **VFA**

            **Size**: 5MB

            **Background**: 4D variable flip angle data for T1-mapping in the 
            abdomen. Data are provided by the liver work package of 
            the `TRISTAN project <https://www.imi-tristan.eu/liver>`_  
            which develops imaging biomarkers for drug safety assessment. 
            The data and analysis was first presented at the ISMRM in 2024 
            (Min et al 2024, manuscript in press). A single set of variable 
            flip angle data are included.

            **Data format**: The fetch function returns a dictionary, which 
            contains the following items: 
            
            - **array**: 4D array of signal intensities in the liver at 
              different flip angles
            - **FA**: flip angles in degrees
            - **spacing**: voxel size in mm in x-, y-, and z-directions as an 
              array.
