Mesa-LLM integrates large language models (LLMs) as decision-making agents into the Mesa agent-based modeling (ABM) framework. It enables sophisticated, language-driven agent behaviors, allowing researchers to model scenarios involving communication, negotiation, and decision-making influenced by natural language.

> **⚠️ WARNING ⚠️**
> This repository is currently under active development. The API and functionality may change significantly. Please stay tuned for our first release coming soon!

## Using Mesa-LLM

To install Mesa-LLM, run:
```bash
pip install -U mesa-llm
```

Mesa-LLM pre-releases can be installed with:
```bash
pip install -U --pre mesa-llm
```

You can also use `pip` to install the GitHub version:
```bash
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/wang-boyu/mesa-llm.git#egg=mesa-llm
```

Or any other (development) branch on this repo or your own fork:
``` bash
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/YOUR_FORK/mesa-llm@YOUR_BRANCH#egg=mesa-llm
```
