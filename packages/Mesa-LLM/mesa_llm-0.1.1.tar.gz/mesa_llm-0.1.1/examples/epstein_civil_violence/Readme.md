# Epstein Civil Violence Model

## Summary

This model is based on Joshua Epstein's simulation of how civil unrest grows and is suppressed. Citizen agents wander the grid randomly, and are endowed with individual risk aversion and hardship levels; there is also a universal regime legitimacy value. There are also Cop agents, who work on behalf of the regime. Cops arrest Citizens who are actively rebelling; Citizens decide whether to rebel based on their hardship and the regime legitimacy, and their perceived probability of arrest.

The model generates mass uprising as self-reinforcing processes: if enough agents are rebelling, the probability of any individual agent being arrested is reduced, making more agents more likely to join the uprising. However, the more rebelling Citizens the Cops arrest, the less likely additional agents become to join.

This model is implemented using Mesa-LLM unlike the original Mesa and NetLogo versions. All agents have the ability to think and use tools (arresting citizens for cops, changing their state, etc.) depending on their reasoning method.

## Technical Details

The **Epstein Civil Violence Model** simulates the dynamics of civil unrest using two types of agents: **Citizens** and **Cops**.

Each **Citizen** agent is characterized by individual attributes such as:

- `hardship`
- `risk_aversion`
- `threshold` (for rebellion)

Additionally, all Citizens share a common perception of `regime_legitimacy`.

---

### Rebellion Rule

A Citizen becomes (or remains) *active* (i.e., rebels) if the following condition is met:

```
grievance - (risk_aversion * arrest_probability) > threshold
```

Where:

```
grievance = hardship * (1 - regime_legitimacy)
```

---

### Arrest Probability

The perceived probability of arrest is calculated as:

```
arrest_probability = 1 - exp(-k * round(cops_in_vision / actives_in_vision))
```

Where:

- `k` is a constant
- `cops_in_vision` is the number of cops within the agent’s vision
- `actives_in_vision` is the number of active Citizens (including the agent itself)

---

### Cops' Behavior

**Cops** patrol the grid and attempt to **arrest active Citizens** within their vision.

---

### LLM-Powered Agents

Both Citizens and Cops are implemented as **LLM-powered agents**, meaning:

- Their actions (e.g., `move`, `change state`, `arrest`) are determined by a **reasoning module**.
- This module takes as input:
  - The agent’s internal state
  - Local observations
  - A set of available tools

This design enables **flexible, context-aware decision-making** that incorporates both:

- Quantitative attributes (e.g., `hardship`, `risk_aversion`)
- Qualitative reasoning (e.g., situational awareness, adaptive strategy)




## How to Run

If you have cloned the repo into your local machine, ensure you run the following command from the root of the library: ``pip install -e . ``. Then, you will need an api key of an LLM-provider of your choice. (This model in particular makes a large amount of calls per minute and we therefore recommend getting a paid version of an api-key that can offer high rate-limits). Once you have obtained the api-key follow the below steps to set it up for this model.
1) Ensure the dotenv package is installed. If not, run ``pip install python-dotenv``.
2) In the root folder of the project, create a file named .env.
3) If you are using openAI's api key, add the following command in the .env file: ``OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx``. If you have the paid version of Gemini, use this line instead: ``GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here``(the free ones tend to not work with this model).
4) Change the  ``api_key`` specification in app.py according to the provider you have chosen.
5) Similarly change the ``llm_model`` attribute as well in app.py to the name of a model you have access to. Ensure it is in the form of {provider}/{model_name}. For e.g. ``openai/gpt-4o-mini``.

Once you have set up the api-key in your system, run the following command from this directory:

```
    $ solara run app.py
```
