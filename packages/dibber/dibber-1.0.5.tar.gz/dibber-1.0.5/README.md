# Dibber - Docker image builder

Builds your container images automatically, like magic. Good for handling common base images for all your
projects, apps, whatever.

Usage examples:

- [Lietu's Docker Images](https://github.com/lietu/docker-images)
- [IOXIOÂ® Docker Images](https://github.com/ioxiocom/docker-images)

## How do you use this then?

If you want to use it with GitHub it takes just a few steps:

1. Create a new repository based on the
   [template repository](https://github.com/lietu/docker-images-template).

2. Fill in `dibber.toml`: Basically you need to set up your GitHub username prefixed by the `ghcr.io` for them
   to land in GitHub packages

3. Images and versions: First level of subdirectories in this repo is "images", as in the repository names
   (`username/<repository>`) for Docker hub. The subdirectories in that defines the "versions" - basically
   default tags for things to be built for that repository. Put your `Dockerfile` and accompanying files under
   `<image>/<version>/`

4. Additional tags: In `<image>/<version>/config.yaml` you can define additional tags for the built image,
   like `latest`, or whatever aliases you may want for it.

If you want to do it on your own pipelines, you can do the above but pay a bit more attention to `dibber.toml`
and then on your pipeline agent run in the checkout:

```
pip install dibber
dibber build-multiplatform
dibber upload
dibber scan
```

If you have images other images depend on, check out the `priority_builds` -setting. Each list within it gets
assigned a priority and can be built in parallel with `--parallel` argument, the rest of the images will then
get built after everything in the `priority_builds`.

```python
# Simple priority to a couple of images
priority_builds = [
   "ubuntu-base/20.04",
   "ubuntu-base/22.04",
]
```

```python
# Tiered priorities of things that depend on earlier priorities
priority_builds = [
  [
      "ubuntu-base/20.04",
      "ubuntu-base/22.04",
  ],
  [
      "python-base/ubuntu20.04-python3.9",
      "python-base/ubuntu22.04-python3.10",
  ]
]
```

## But what does it require?

You will need:

- [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) >= 20.10.0 (we use `docker push --all-tags` to save some
  time)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.11
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) (at least for development)

You can also use this to push to Dockerhub (but why would you want to). If you do you'll just need to add a
`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secret ("token" is a
[personal access token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/)) that will be used to log into your
account for upload. This needs to be for the Docker hub user configured in `dibber.toml`.

The `scan` command uses `trivy` which you will need installed on your system first.

## Multiplatform support

There are several technical restrictions when building images for multiple platforms with `buildx`, such as
that `buildx` can't find an image in local docker environment (see notes in
[output](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#output) section of the docs). But
it's possible to push base images right away to a docker registry and then explicitly define this registry in
`FROM` statements.

That's why there are 2 options to build images:

- `dibber build` builds all images for the current platform only with `docker build` under the hood. It's
  suitable for local development of the images
- `dibber build-multiplatform` builds all images using `docker buildx build` for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.
  It requires extra setup (check
  [pipeline code](https://github.com/lietu/docker-images-template/tree/main/.github/workflows/build-and-upload.yaml))
  and is not recommended for local development

## Contributions

If you plan on contributing to the code ensure you use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) to
guarantee the code style stays uniform etc.

Also, please open an issue first to discuss the idea before sending a PR so that you know if it would be
wanted or needs re-thinking or if you should just make a fork for yourself.

You'll likely want to clone this repository, then in its parent directory run:

```shell
uv tool install --editable dibber
```

## If I use this it means you own my things, right?
