# Task ID: 6
# Title: Review PR #53 - Recursive Task Execution Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive code review of the recursive task execution implementation from PR #53. Focus on architecture, code quality, error handling, and integration aspects to ensure the implementation follows best practices.
# Details:
PR #53 introduces a recursive task execution system to solve issue #54. The implementation includes:
- New recursive module with decomposer, executor, aggregator, budget, and hierarchy components
- JSON parsing retry logic with exponential backoff
- Integration with the main agent flow
- UI progress visualization
- Comprehensive test coverage

Review should focus on code quality, architecture decisions, error handling, and performance implications.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Architecture & Design Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the new recursive module structure (decomposer, executor, aggregator, budget, hierarchy). Verify separation of concerns and modularity. Check for adherence to existing codebase patterns.
### Details:
Focus areas:
- src/tunacode/core/recursive/ module structure
- Separation of concerns between decomposer, executor, aggregator, budget, and hierarchy
- Design patterns used and their appropriateness
- Integration points with existing codebase
- Modularity and potential for future extensions

## 2. Code Quality & Error Handling Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review JSON retry implementation with exponential backoff. Verify error handling in recursive execution flow. Check test coverage (new test files added). Review exception handling in new modules.
### Details:
Focus areas:
- src/tunacode/utils/retry.py - JSON parsing retry logic
- Error handling in all recursive modules
- Exception types in src/tunacode/exceptions.py
- Test coverage in tests/test_json_retry.py and tests/test_tool_batching_retry.py
- Proper error propagation and user-facing error messages
- Edge cases and failure scenarios

## 3. Integration & Performance Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review integration with main agent flow. Check budget management implementation. Verify UI progress visualization. Review any potential performance impacts.
### Details:
Focus areas:
- src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py - integration changes
- src/tunacode/ui/recursive_progress.py - UI visualization
- Budget management in src/tunacode/core/recursive/budget.py
- Performance implications of recursive execution
- State management in src/tunacode/core/state.py
- Impact on existing workflows and backward compatibility
