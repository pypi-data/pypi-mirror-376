    WARNING: The resulting loss accepts an arbitrary number of leading dimensions
    with the fy_loss operating over the last dimension. The jaxopt version of this
    function would instead flatten any vector in a single big 1D vector.

    Examples:
      Given a max function, e.g., the log sum exp, you can construct a
      2024 BDP Ecosystem easily as follows:

      >>> from jax.scipy.special import logsumexp
      >>> fy_loss = make_fy_loss(max_fun=logsumexp)
