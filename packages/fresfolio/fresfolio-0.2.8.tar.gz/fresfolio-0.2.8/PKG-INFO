##  fresfolio [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pip/badge/?version=stable)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/?badge=stable) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/fresfolio)](https://pepy.tech/project/fresfolio)

*fresfolio* stands for "**F**or **Res**earch **Folio**". It is a browser-based note-taking app designed to help researchers organize and track their projects, datasets, analyses, and results in a structured format. Although the name emphasizes â€œresearch", *fresfolio* is equally suitable for personal use, allowing individuals to manage hobby and student projects, or any collection of work in an organized and interactive way. It provides tools for creating rich documentation making it easier to share findings with collaborators.

The rationale behind *fresfolio* is the following:

* User creates **Projects**.
* Each project has one or more **Notebooks**.
* Each notebook has one or more **Chapters**. 
* Each chapter has one or more **Sections**.

*fresfolio* uses Flask as a backend and Vue3 as a frontend.
