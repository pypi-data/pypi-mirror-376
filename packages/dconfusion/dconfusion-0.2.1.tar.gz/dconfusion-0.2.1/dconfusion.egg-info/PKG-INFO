# DConfusion
A Python package for working with confusion matrices.

## Overview
`dconfusion` is a lightweight Python package that provides basic statistical functionality for working with confusion matrices. Confusion matrices are a crucial tool in machine learning and data analysis, allowing you to evaluate the performance of classification models.

## Features
* Basic confusion matrix representation
* Frequency calculation for each cell in the matrix

## Installation
You can install `dconfusion` using pip:

```bash
pip install dconfusion
```

Usage
Here's an example of how to use dconfusion:

# Binary classification (existing usage)
``` python
binary_cm = DConfusion(80, 70, 10, 20)
```

# Multi-class from matrix
``` python
multiclass_cm = DConfusion(
    confusion_matrix=[[50, 3, 2], [8, 45, 1], [4, 2, 48]], 
    labels=['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird']
)
```

# Multi-class from predictions
``` python
y_true = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird', 'Cat', 'Dog']
y_pred = ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Cat', 'Dog']  
cm = DConfusion.from_predictions(y_true, y_pred)
```

# Get class-specific metrics
``` python
# Get metrics for a specific class
cat_metrics = multiclass_cm.get_class_metrics(class_label='Cat')
# Returns: {'precision': 0.91, 'recall': 0.83, 'f1_score': 0.87, 'specificity': 0.95}
```

# Get overall metrics
```
overall_metrics = multiclass_cm.get_all_metrics()
```

# Plot confusion matrix
```python
cm = DConfusion(80, 70, 10, 20)
fig = cm.plot()

# Normalized with custom styling
fig2 = cm.plot(normalize=True, cmap='Blues', figsize=(10, 8))

# With metrics panel (binary only)
fig3 = cm.plot(show_metrics=True)

multiclass_cm = DConfusion(
    confusion_matrix=[[50, 3, 2], [8, 45, 1], [4, 2, 48]],
    labels=['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird']
)

fig4 = multiclass_cm.plot(normalize=True, cmap='cool') # If we show metrics, only accuracy is displayed
fig4.show()
```

# Roadmap
This is the initial release (v0.2.1) of dconfusion, and we plan to add more features in future releases. Some potential features include:
- Backtracing statistical metrics based on partial data
- Integration with popular machine learning libraries
