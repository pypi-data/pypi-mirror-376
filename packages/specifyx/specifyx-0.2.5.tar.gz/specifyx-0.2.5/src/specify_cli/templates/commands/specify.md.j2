Start a new feature by creating a specification and feature branch for {{ project_name }}.

This is the first step in the Spec-Driven Development lifecycle.

Given the feature description provided as an argument, do this:

1. Run the command `specifyx run create-feature "description" --json` (or `uvx specifyx run create-feature "description" --json` if specifyx not found) from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.

   **Branch Naming Information:**
   - Default patterns usually include: `feature/{feature-name}`, `hotfix/{bug-id}`, `bugfix/{bug-id}`, `main`, `development`
   - The command auto-generates branch names from the first pattern and description unless `--branch-name` is specified
   - Custom branch names: `specifyx run create-feature "description" --branch-name "feature/custom-name" --json`
   - **No-branch workflow**: `specifyx run create-feature "description" --no-branch --json` (stays on current branch, no branch switching)
   - Branch names are validated against patterns in `.specify/config.toml`
   - Feature descriptions should be 3-100 characters and contain at least one letter
   - IMPORTANT: It is recommended to use custom branch names to be more clear about the feature
   
   **Troubleshooting:**
   - If command fails, check: `specifyx run create-feature --help` for full usage
   - If branch exists: switch to it manually or use a different name
   - If not in git repo: run `git init` first
   - If patterns unclear: check `.specify/config.toml` under `[branch_naming.patterns]`
2. Load the generated spec file to understand required sections.
3. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.
4. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, and readiness for the next phase.

Note: The `specifyx run create-feature` command creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing. Use `--no-branch` to skip branch creation and work on the current branch.
