üòÅUse new YAML classes (#1944)

# Description

These classes are already implemented and well tested. Setting the
`yaml_cls` in the Loader (CRUD interface) will start using this in the
build command to validate the YAML syntax of the user.

## Details:
The testing of the YAML resource classes we use to validate the syntax
of the user configurations:
https://github.com/cognitedata/toolkit/tree/main/tests/test_unit/test_cdf_tk/test_resource_classes

Then, by setting yaml_cls in the resource loader (will be renamed
ResourceCRUD), it will be used in the cdf build command to give the user
a warning about whether they follow the syntax here:
https://github.com/cognitedata/toolkit/blob/main/cognite_toolkit/_cdf_tk/commands/build_cmd.py#L603
