    source_video: str,
    target_video: str,
) -> None:
    """
    Render the ball's trajectory as a 2D overlay on a canonical soccer pitch and write it as a video.

    This pipeline ingests a broadcast (camera) video, detects the ball in each frame using the
    default object-detection model, periodically estimates a frameâ†’pitch homography from pitch
    keypoints, projects the ball position into pitch coordinates, and draws the evolving path
    on a pitch-sized canvas. Outlier jumps are suppressed with a simple distance-based filter
    to reduce spurious spikes when detections momentarily fail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_video : str
        Path to the input broadcast video. Must be readable by OpenCV/Supervision.
    target_video : str
        Path to the output MP4 (or other codec supported by Supervision). The output resolution
        matches the pitch template defined by the library's default configuration.
        
    Notes
    -----
    - Models, device selection (CPU/CUDA/MPS), pitch template, and video I/O are initialized via
      ``init_runtime``. If PyTorch/Ultralytics are not installed correctly, import/runtime errors will propagate.
      
    Returns
    -------
    None
        Writes ``target_video`` to disk; raises on I/O/model errors.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> write_ball_path_2d_video("content/match_clip.mp4", "output/ball_path.mp4")
