Pytricia is a Python module to store IP prefixes in a
patricia tree. It's based on Dave Plonka's modified patricia tree
code, and has three things to recommend it over related modules
(including py-radix and SubnetTree):

 * it's faster,

 * it works nicely in Python 3, and

 * there are a few nicer library features for manipulating the structure.

See the github repo for documentation and some performance numbers: <https://github.com/jsommers/pytricia>.
