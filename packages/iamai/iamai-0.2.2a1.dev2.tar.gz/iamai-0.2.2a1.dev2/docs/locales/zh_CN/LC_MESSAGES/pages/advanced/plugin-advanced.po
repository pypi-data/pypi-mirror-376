"Sometimes, we may need to control the propagation of events. Besides the "
"basic `block` attribute, which decides whether the event propagation "
"continues after this plugin execution, iamai provides some methods for "
"advanced logic control."

"The `skip()` method is used to skip the current plugin and continue event"
" propagation. Typically, you could achieve a similar effect using the "
"`return` statement in the `handle()` method. However, the `skip()` method"
" simplifies certain operations in some cases. For example:"

"The `stop()` method is used to end the current event propagation. "
"However, please note that when this method is called, the current event "
"propagation is not immediately terminated. Plugins with the same priority"
" as the current one will still be executed. In other words, the `stop()` "
"method prevents plugins with lower priority from being executed."

"You may notice that setting the block attribute to `True` and adding a "
"`self.stop()` statement at the end of the `handle()` method do not have "
"much difference. In most cases, they are indeed equivalent, except for "
"one scenario. When an exception occurs in the handle() method, the final "
"self.stop() statement will not be executed, but the block attribute will "
"still take effect. In other words, setting block to True and the "
"following example are roughly equivalent:"
