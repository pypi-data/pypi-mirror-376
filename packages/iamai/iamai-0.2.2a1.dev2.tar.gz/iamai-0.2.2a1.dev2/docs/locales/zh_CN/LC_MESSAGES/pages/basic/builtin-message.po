"It overrides the `__init__()` method to allow initialization with objects"
" of types: str, Mapping, Iterable[Mapping], MessageSegment, and Message."
"  Note that str is not natively supported and needs to be implemented by "
"the adapter developer.  When a Message object of the same type is passed "
"in during initialization, a new Message object with the same content will"
" be created. When a MessageSegment object is passed in, it will be added "
"to the list. Mapping and Iterable[Mapping] are mainly for the convenience"
" of using pydantic to process events in the adapter,  which regular users"
" do not need to be concerned about."
