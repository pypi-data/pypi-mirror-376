# Legacy load.py - ALL FUNCTIONS MOVED TO REFACTORED MODULES

# All loader functions have been moved to organized modules:
# - Documents: attachments/loaders/documents/ (PDF, Office, Text, HTML)
# - Media: attachments/loaders/media/ (Images, Archives)
# - Data: attachments/loaders/data/ (CSV)
# - Web: attachments/loaders/web/ (URLs)
# - Repositories: attachments/loaders/repositories/ (Git, Directories)

# Functions are automatically imported and registered via:
# from . import loaders  # in __init__.py

# TODO: Remove this file once confirmed all functionality works
