Example Specialized Processors
==============================

Demonstrates specialized processors that are NOT automatically used by Attachments()
but are available through explicit access via processors.name.

Key Distinction:
- Primary processors (no name): Auto-registered for Attachments() simple API
- Named processors (with name): Only available via processors.name explicit access

Usage:
    # This will NOT use the specialized processors below
    ctx = Attachments("document.pdf")  # Uses primary processor

    # This WILL use the specialized processors
    result = processors.academic_pdf(attach("paper.pdf"))
    result = processors.legal_pdf(attach("contract.pdf"))
    result = processors.financial_pdf(attach("report.pdf"))
