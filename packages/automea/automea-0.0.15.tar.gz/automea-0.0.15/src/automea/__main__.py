        Plot a window of the signal with detected spikes, reverberations, bursts, and network bursts.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signal : array_like
            The input signal data.
        start_time : float, optional
            The start time of the window in seconds. Default is None (start from the beginning).
        duration : float, optional
            The duration of the window in seconds. Default is None (plot until the end of the signal).
        threshold : float, optional
            The threshold value for plotting. Default is None (no threshold line).
        spikes : array_like, optional
            The timestamps of detected spikes. Default is None (no spikes in the plot)
        reverberations : array_like, optional
            The timestamps data of detected reverberations. Default is None

            Name of the generated plot figure.
        show : bool, optional
            Whether to show or not the plot. Default is True.
        figsize : tuple, optional
            The size of the figure (width, height) in inches. Default is (6, 6).
        yunits : str, optional
            The units of the y-axis. Default is 'a.u.' (arbitrary units).

        - It normalizes the signal if yunits is 'a.u.' and converts it to millivolts (mV) if yunits is 'mV'.
        - Detected spikes, reverberations, bursts, and network bursts are overlaid on the plot with different colors.
