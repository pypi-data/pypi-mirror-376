			# Sibyl

			Sibyl is a static site builder written in Python. It allows you to easily create, develop, and build static websites with a Single Page Application (SPA) feel. With its simple-to-use commands, hot reloading capabilities, and partial page loading, Sibyl makes your web development process seamless and efficient.

			## Features

			* Blazing fast websites
			* Ready for deployment to Cloudflare Pages
			* Hot reloading on the development server
			* Navigation between pages like a SPA with partial page loading

			## Installation

			Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can download the latest version of Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

			To install Sibyl, make sure you have access to this GitHub repo from your shell (see adding ssh keys below) and run the following command:

			```bash
			pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/isat-sibyl/sibyl.git#egg=sibyl[dev]
			```

			## Adding ssh keys to your shell (if needed)

			If you do not have access to this GitHub repo from your shell, you will need to add your ssh keys to your shell. To do this, follow the instructions below:

			1. Generate a new ssh key by running the following command (replace the email with your own):

			```bash
			ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
			```

			2. Manually clone any repo via ssh before proceeding to the next step. For example, to clone this repo, run:

			```bash
			git clone git@github.com:isat-sibyl/sibyl.git
			```

			You will be prompted to trust the host. Verify that the fingerprint matches GitHub's fingerprint and type `yes` to continue.

			3. Follow the steps in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add your ssh key to your GitHub account.

			## Usage

			### Initializing a new project

			To create a new project, navigate to the desired directory and run the following command:

			```
			sibyl init
			```

			or

			```bash
			python -m sibyl.init
			```

			This will generate a new project structure with the necessary files.

			### Starting a development server

			To start a development server with hot reloading, navigate to your project directory and run:

			```bash
			sibyl dev
			```

			Once the server is up and running, you can view your website at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

			### Building for production

			To build your website for production, navigate to your project directory and run:

			```
			sibyl build
			```

			This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the production-ready static files.

			```python
			from sibyl import Sibyl
			app = Sibyl()
			```
