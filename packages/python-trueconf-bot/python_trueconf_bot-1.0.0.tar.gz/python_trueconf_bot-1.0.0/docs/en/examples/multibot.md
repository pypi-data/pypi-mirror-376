# Multibot

The TrueConf team has prepared an example that demonstrates the use of four bots at once (all-in-one):

- Echo bot
- Sick-leave bot that forwards messages to an HR group
- Monitoring bot for external service statistics (TrueConf Server)
- GPT bot that runs a local LLM model in the background
