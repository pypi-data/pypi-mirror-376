# turintech-evoml-client

Python client library to support script and notebook interactions with the platform


## Installation
There are two options to install the client library:

### Default installation

Installs basic requirements and versions of libraries like pandas, numpy.

```shell
pip install turintech_evoml_client
```

### Full installation
 
If you want to be able to generate models locally make sure you use the `full` extra when installing evoml_client.

```shell
pip install turintech_evoml_client[full]
```
Note that if you are using zsh, you might need to use one the following command instead:

```shell
pip install turintech_evoml_client\[full\]
pip install "turintech_evoml_client[full]"
noglob pip install turintech_evoml_client[full]
```


## Description

Currently supports the following concepts and actions:

### Datasets:
* Creation - EvoML client supports: Pandas DataFrames, numpy arrays and csv files. With 
Additional support to come.
* Uploading - Send the locally defined Dataset to the platform in preparation for future
trials.
* Statistical analysis - Using the Analyser class retrieve statistical info on the uploaded
dataset.

### Trials:
* Configuration - Multiple levels of abstraction provided by the TrialConfig class to allow
specification of as much or as little technical details as desired.
* Uploading - Send the locally defined trial to the platform to await execution.
* Execution - Trigger the optimization of the given trial.
* Result retrieval - Get either all models or the best model for a trial.
* local execution - Once retrieved and built, models can be run locally against new data.

### AutoML:
* Given a Pandas Dataframe, Numpy array or EvoML dataset and a target column
returns the best model trained to predict the given target column.
