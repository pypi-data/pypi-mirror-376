        Install
        -------
        
        Install from snap store
        
        This release is also available for download and install from the snap store @ https://snapcraft.io/ubuntu-cloud-image-changelog
        
        ```
        sudo snap install ubuntu-cloud-image-changelog
        ```
        
        This is a strict snap as recommended for most snaps, see https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-confinement for more details.
        
        
        Install from PyPi
        
        ```
        pip install ubuntu-cloud-image-changelog
        ```
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        ```
        ubuntu-cloud-image-changelog generate --from-manifest manifest1.manifest --to-manifest manifest2.manifest --from-series focal --to-series focal
        ```
        
        If Packages in manifest are known to have been installed from this PPA then you can pass one of more PPAs to ubuntu-cloud-image-changelog for the changelog for those packages to be included in the output.
        
        ```
        --ppa
        ```
        
        Expected format is '%LAUNCHPAD_USERNAME%/%PPA_NAME%' eg. philroche/cloud-init
        
        ```
        --highlight-cves
        ```
        
        Highlight the CVEs referenced in each individual changelog entry
        
        ```
        --output-json changelog.json
        ```
        
        Output changelog to local `changelog.json` file
        
        ```
        --output-json-pretty
        ```
        
        Pretty print JSON output with 4 character indentation.  `--output-json` must also be used for this to take affect.
        
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * There are opportunities to improve performance by parallelizing the source package changelog queries and parsing.
        * Refactor the generate function as it is way too long and complex.
        * Add tests for the generate function.

          shim-signed is a special package as it appends the version of the
          binary shim from Microsoft. This full version will not appear in
          the manifest so we can safely remove anything after the binary shim version.
