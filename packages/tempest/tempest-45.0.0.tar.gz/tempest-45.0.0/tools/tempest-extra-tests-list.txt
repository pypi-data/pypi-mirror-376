# This file includes the list of tests which need to be
# excluded to run from integrated testing (tempest-full job
# or other generic jobs. We will run these tests in a separate
# jobs. This is needed to avoid the job timeout, details in
# bug#2004780.
# Basic criteria to add test in this list is:
# * Admin test which are not needed for interop and most of them
#   are running as part of other API and Scenario tests.
# * Negative tests which are mostly covered in tempest API tests
#   or service unit/functional tests.

# All admin tests except keystone admin test which might not have much
# coverage in existing other tests
tempest.api.compute.admin
tempest.api.volume.admin
tempest.api.image.admin
tempest.api.network.admin

# This also run cinder-tempest-plugin tests so that we can avoid any
# breaking change to plugins (cinder-tempest-plugins uses most of the
# Tempest interface) but we can add more plugins tests here if needed.
cinder_tempest_plugin

# All negative tests
