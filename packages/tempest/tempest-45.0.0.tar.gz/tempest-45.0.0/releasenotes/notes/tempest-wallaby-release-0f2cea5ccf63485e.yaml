prelude: |
    This release is to tag Tempest for OpenStack Wallaby release.
    This release marks the start of Wallaby release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Wallaby
    * Victoria
    * Ussuri
    * Train

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Xena development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Xena cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Xena (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Wallaby release.
