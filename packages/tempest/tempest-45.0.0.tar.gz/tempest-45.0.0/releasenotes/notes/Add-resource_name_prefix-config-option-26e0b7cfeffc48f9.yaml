    A new config option in the default section, resource_name_prefix,
    is added to allow users to customize the name (specifically the prefix)
    of the resources created by Tempest during a test run. By default it is
    set to tempest.
    Tempest cleanup CLI will then use this config option to cleanup only the
    resources that match the prefix. Make sure this prefix does not match with
    the resource name you do not want Tempest cleanup CLI to delete.
