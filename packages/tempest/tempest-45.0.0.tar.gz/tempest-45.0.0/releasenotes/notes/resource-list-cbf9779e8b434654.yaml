    A new interface ``--resource-list`` has been introduced in the
    ``tempest cleanup`` command to remove the resources created by
    Tempest. A new config option in the default section, ``record_resources``,
    is added to allow the recording of all resources created by Tempest.
    A list of these resources will be saved in ``resource_list.json`` file,
    which will be appended in case of multiple Tempest runs. This file
    is intended to be used with the ``tempest cleanup`` command if it is
    used with the newly added option ``--resource-list``.
