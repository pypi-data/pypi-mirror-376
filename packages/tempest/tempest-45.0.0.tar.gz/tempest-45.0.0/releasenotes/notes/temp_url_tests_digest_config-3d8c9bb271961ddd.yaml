features:
  - |
    Add configuration parameter `tempurl_digest_hashlib` into
    `object-storage-feature-enabled` which configures the hashing algorithm to
    use for the temp_url tests; defaults to 'sha256'.
security:
  - |
    Swift used to support only 'sha1' for temp_url hashing but from many
    years now 'sha256' and 'sha512' are also available. These are stronger
    than 'sha1' and tempest now allows configuring which one to use.
