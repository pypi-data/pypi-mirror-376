    img_dir scenario option has been deprecated and it's being removed.
    Starting Tempest 25.0.0 release, CONF.scenario.img_file needs a full path
    for the image. Until this release, old behavior was maintained and kept
    working however a user needs to specify the full path in
    CONF.scenario.img_file config option from now on.
