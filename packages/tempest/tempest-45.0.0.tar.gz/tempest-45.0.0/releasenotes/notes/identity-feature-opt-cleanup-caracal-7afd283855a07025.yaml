upgrade:
  - |
    The following deprecated options in the ``[identity-feature-enabled]``
    section have been removed. Project tags API and application credentials
    API are now always tested if identity v3 API is available.

    - ``project_tag``
    - ``application_credentials``

  - |
    Default value of the ``[identity-feature-enabled] access_rule`` option has
    been changed from ``False`` to ``True`` and now the access rule API is
    always tested when identity API is available.

deprecations:
  - |
    The Keystone access_rule is enabled by default since Train release and we
    no longer need a separate config in Tempest to enable it. Therefore
    the ``[identity-feature-enabled] access_rule`` option has been deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release.
