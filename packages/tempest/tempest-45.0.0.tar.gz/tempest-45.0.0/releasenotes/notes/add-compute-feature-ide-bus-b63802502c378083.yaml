    A new ``[compute-feature-enabled]ide_bus`` config option has been
    introduced to indicate if the environment supports attaching disks to an
    instance using an ``IDE`` bus.

    This currently defaults to ``True`` but should be set to ``False`` when
    using the libvirt OpenStack Nova virt driver *and* the ``q35`` machine type
    as support for this bus is no longer provided.
