    Adding new config option for volume tests which allows to specify the size
    a volume will be extended by (if a test does extend a volume or needs
    a new bigger volume). The option is beneficial in case such tests are
    executed on systems where the chunk size (the minimum size a volume can be
    extended by) is other than 1 (originally hardcoded in the tests).:
