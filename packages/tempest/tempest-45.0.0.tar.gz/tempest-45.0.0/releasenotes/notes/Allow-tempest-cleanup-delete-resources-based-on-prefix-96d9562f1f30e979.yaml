    We add a new argument, ``--prefix``, to ``tempest cleanup`` tool that will
    allow users delete only resources that match the prefix. When this option
    is used, ``saved_state.json`` file is not needed (no need to run with
    ``--init-saved-state`` first). If there is one, it will be ignored and the
    cleanup will be done based on the given prefix only.
    Note, that some resources are not named thus they will not be deleted when
    filtering based on the prefix.
