    Adds a ``ssh_allow_agent`` parameter to the ``RemoteClient`` class
    wrapper and the direct ssh ``Client`` class to allow a caller to
    explicitly request that the SSH Agent is not consulted for
    authentication. This is useful if your attempting explicit password
    based authentication as ``paramiko``, the underlying library used for
    SSH, defaults to utilizing an ssh-agent process before attempting
    password authentication.
