    Added a new config option in the `image` section, `http_qcow2_image`,
    which will use `qcow2` format image to download from the external
    source specified and use it for image conversion in glance tests. By
    default it will download
    `http://download.cirros-cloud.net/0.6.2/cirros-0.6.2-x86_64-disk.img`
