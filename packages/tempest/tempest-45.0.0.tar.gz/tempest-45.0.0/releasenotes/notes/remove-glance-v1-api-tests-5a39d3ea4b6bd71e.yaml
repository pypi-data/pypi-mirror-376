prelude: >
    Glance v1 APIs were removed in Rocky release and last
    supported release for v1 was Queens. Tempest master does
    not support the Rocky or Queens release so we removed
    the Glance v1 tests, config option, and its service clients.
    If you would like to test the v1 APIs then you can use the old
    Tempest version.
