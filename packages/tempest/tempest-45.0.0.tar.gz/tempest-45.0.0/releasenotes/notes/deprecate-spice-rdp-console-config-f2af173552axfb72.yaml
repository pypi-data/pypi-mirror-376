deprecations:
  - |
    The config option ``CONF.compute.rdp_console``
    is deprecated because test cases using it have been removed.
    We can add it back when adding the test cases again.
  - |
    The config option ``CONF.compute.spice_console`` was previously listed as
    deprecated, but is now back in active use to support the testing of SPICE consoles
    in Nova.
