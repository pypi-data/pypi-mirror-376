upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``[compute-feature-enabled] block_migrate_cinder_iscsi``
    option has been removed.
    Now the ``[compute-feature-enabled] block_migration_for_live_migration``
    option is solely used to determine when to run block migration based tests
    during live migration.
