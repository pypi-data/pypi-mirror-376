    Added new module net_downtime including the fixture NetDowntimeMeter that
    can be used to measure how long the connectivity with an IP is lost
    during certain operations like a server live migration.
    The configuration option allowed_network_downtime has been added with a
    default value of 5.0 seconds, which would be the maximum time that
    the connectivity downtime is expected to last.
