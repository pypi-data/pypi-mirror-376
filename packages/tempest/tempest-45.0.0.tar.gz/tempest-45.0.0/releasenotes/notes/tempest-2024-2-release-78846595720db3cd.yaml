    This release is to tag Tempest for OpenStack 2024.2 release.
    This release marks the start of 2024.2 release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * 2024.2
    * 2024.1
    * 2023.2
    * 2023.1

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack 2025.1 development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the 2025.1 cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a 2025.1 (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack 2024.2 release.
