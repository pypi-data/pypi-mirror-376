prelude: |
    This release is to tag Tempest for OpenStack Xena release.
    This release marks the start of Xena release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Xena
    * Wallaby
    * Victoria
    * Ussuri

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Yoga development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Yoga cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Yoga (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Xena release.
