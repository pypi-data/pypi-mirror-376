prelude: |
    This release is to tag Tempest for OpenStack Yoga release.
    This release marks the start of Yoga release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * Yoga
    * Xena
    * Wallaby
    * Victoria
    * Ussuri

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack Zed development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the Zed cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a Zed (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack Yoga release.
