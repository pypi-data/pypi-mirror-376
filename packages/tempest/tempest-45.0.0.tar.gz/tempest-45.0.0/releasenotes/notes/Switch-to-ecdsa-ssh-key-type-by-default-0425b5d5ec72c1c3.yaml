    As the version of cirros used in OpenStack CI does not support SHA-2
    signatures for ssh, any connection from a FIPS enabled machine will fail
    in case validation.ssh_key_type is set to rsa (the default until now).
    Using ecdsa keys helps us avoid the mentioned issue.
    From now on, the validation.ssh_key_type option will be set to ecdsa
    by default for testing simplicity.
    This change shouldn't have any drastic effect on any tempest consumer,
    in case rsa ssh type is required in a consumer's scenario,
    validation.ssh_key_type can be overridden to rsa.
