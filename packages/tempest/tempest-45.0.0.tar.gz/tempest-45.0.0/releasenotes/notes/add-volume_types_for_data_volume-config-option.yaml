    A new config option in the ``volume_feature_enabled`` section,
    ``volume_types_for_data_volume``, is added to allow the user to specify
    which volume types can be used for data volumes in a new test
    ``test_instances_with_cinder_volumes_on_all_compute_nodes``. By default,
    this option is set to None.
