    There was a bug (bug#1964509) in dynamic credentials creation where
    project credentials with different roles are created with the new
    projects. Credential of different role of projects must be created
    within the same project. For exmaple, 'project_admin', 'project_member',
    'project_reader', and 'primary', credentials will be created in the
    same projects. 'alt', 'project_alt_admin', 'project_alt_member',
    'project_alt_reader' will be created within the same project.

    'admin' credenatials is considered and kept as legacy admin and
    will be created under new project. If any test want to test with
    admin role in projectA and non-admin/admin in projectB then test
    can request projectA admin using 'admin' or 'project_alt_admin'
    and non-admin in projectB using 'primary', 'project_member',
    or 'project_reader'/admin in projectB using 'project_admin'. Many
    existing tests using the 'admin' with new project to assert on the
    resource list so we are keeping 'admin' a kind of legacy admin.
