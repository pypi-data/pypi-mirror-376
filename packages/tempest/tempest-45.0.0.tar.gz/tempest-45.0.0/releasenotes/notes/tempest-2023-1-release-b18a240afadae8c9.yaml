prelude: |
    This release is to tag Tempest for OpenStack 2023.1 release.
    This release marks the start of 2023.1 release support in Tempest.
    After this release, Tempest will support below OpenStack Releases:

    * 2023.1
    * Zed
    * Yoga
    * Xena

    Current development of Tempest is for OpenStack 2023.2 development
    cycle. Every Tempest commit is also tested against master during
    the 2023.2 cycle. However, this does not necessarily mean that using
    Tempest as of this tag will work against a 2023.2 (or future release)
    cloud.
    To be on safe side, use this tag to test the OpenStack 2023.1 release.
