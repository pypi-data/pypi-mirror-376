    A final note from mike...
    
        “Don’t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. 
        For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater.”
            — Viktor Frankl
    
        I first saw this quote in a truncated format:
            "Happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater."    
    
        Everyone is different, but my experience with the PySimpleGUI project matches this theory.  It's taken a lifetime of trying and "failing" and trying
        to find happiness before I finally figured this truth-for-me out.  If I do a long list of things, and live life in a kind & loving way, then the
        result is happiness.  It's a biproduct, not a directly produced thing.  This should be taught in school.  Or maybe it can't.
        I hope you find happiness, but more importantly, or maybe first, I hope you find that bigger-than-you thing. For me it's always been programming.  It seems to be
        the giving back part, not just the calling, that makes the happiness fusion-reactor operate.

    "Thank you" has fueled this project. I'm incredibly grateful to have users that are in turn grateful. It's a feedback loop of gratitude. What a fantastic thing!

    Welcome to the "core" PySimpleGUI code....

    It's a mess.... really... it's a mess internally... it's the external-facing interfaces that
    are not a mess.  The Elements and the methods for them are well-designed.
    PEP8 - this code is far far from PEP8 compliant. 
    It was written PRIOR to learning that PEP8 existed. 

    I'll be honest.... started learning Python in Nov 2017, started writing PySimpleGUI in Feb 2018.
    Released PySimpleGUI in July 2018.  I knew so little about Python that my parameters were all named
    using CamelCase.  DOH!  Someone on Reddit set me straight on that.  So overnight I renamed all of the
    parameters to lower case.  Unfortunately, the internal naming conventions have been set.  Mixing them
    with PEP8 at this moment would be even MORE confusing.

    Code I write now, outside PySimpleGUI, IS PEP8 compliant.  

    The variable and function naming in particular are not compliant.  There is
    liberal use of CamelVariableAndFunctionNames, but for anything externally facing, there are aliases
    available for all functions.  If you've got a serious enough problem with 100% PEP8 compliance
    that you'll pass on this package, then that's your right and I invite you to do so.  However, if
    perhaps you're a practical thinker where it's the results that matter, then you'll have no
    trouble with this code base.  There is consisency however.  

    I truly hope you get a lot of enjoyment out of using PySimpleGUI.  It came from good intentions.
