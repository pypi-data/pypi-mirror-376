# Suggesting Improvements to the Documentation Translations

Thank you for your interest in this project! The non‑English documentation is automatically translated by large language models, so mistakes are inevitable. If you notice issues in a language you are familiar with, we warmly welcome your suggestions for improvement.

Before you start contributing, please take a moment to read the following guide to help ensure your suggestions can be smoothly accepted.

# Submit Suggestions via Weblate

We use [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) to manage our documentation translations. You can check the current translation status and submit suggestions on the [project's Weblate page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/pdfmathtranslate-next/).

## How to submit a suggestion

It's very simple to propose translation improvements via Weblate, and you don't even need to register an account. Read on for the step-by-step process.

Assume you want to improve the first sentence in the "Command-line arguments" section of [Advanced → Advanced](docs/en/advanced/advanced.md):

1. Open the [project's Weblate page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/pdfmathtranslate-next/).

2. Click `Search` at the top.
