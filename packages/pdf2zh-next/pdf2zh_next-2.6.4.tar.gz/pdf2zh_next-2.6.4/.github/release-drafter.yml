  ## Windows Specific

  If you are unable to open the file after downloading, please install both [VC17](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and [VC15](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe), then try again.
  ## Assets

  - `pdf2zh-v$RESOLVED_VERSION-BabelDOC-<version>-win64.zip`: pdf2zh **without** assets(font, model, etc.)
  - `pdf2zh-v$RESOLVED_VERSION-BabelDOC-<version>-with-assets-win64.zip`: (**Recommended**) pdf2zh **with** assets(font, model, etc.)

  > [!NOTE]
  > **What is the difference between `pdf2zh-v$RESOLVED_VERSION-BabelDOC-<version>-with-assets-win64.zip` and `pdf2zh-v$RESOLVED_VERSION-BabelDOC-<version>-win64.zip`?**
  >
  > - If you are downloading and using PDFMathTranslate for the first time, it is recommended to download `pdf2zh-v$RESOLVED_VERSION-BabelDOC-<version>-with-assets-win64.zip`.
  > - The `pdf2zh-v$RESOLVED_VERSION-BabelDOC-<version>-with-assets-win64.zip` includes resource files (such as fonts and models) compared to `pdf2zh-v$RESOLVED_VERSION-BabelDOC-<version>-win64.zip`.
  > - The version without assets will also dynamically download resources when running, but the download may fail due to network issues. So starting from the second time, you can use this version. (However, offline environments should still use the version with resource packages)
