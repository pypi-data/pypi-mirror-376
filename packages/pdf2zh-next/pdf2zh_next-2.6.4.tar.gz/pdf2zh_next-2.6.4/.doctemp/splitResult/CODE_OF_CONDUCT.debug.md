## Enforcement Responsibilities

<!-- CHUNK ID: chunk_EE74991B  CHUNK TYPE: paragraph START_LINE:29 -->

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
