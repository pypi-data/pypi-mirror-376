class ParallelStep(BaseCompositeStep, HasInputsMixin):
    """A pipeline step that executes multiple branches in parallel.

    This step wraps multiple branches and executes them concurrently, then merges their results.
    Each branch can be either a single step or a list of steps to be executed sequentially.

    The step supports two execution modes controlled by the `squash` parameter:
    1. Squashed (default): Uses asyncio.gather() to run branches in parallel within a single LangGraph node. Use for:
       a. Better raw performance
       b. Simpler implementation
       c. Less overhead
       d. Less transparent for debugging and tracing
    2. Expanded (squash=False): Creates a native LangGraph structure with multiple parallel paths. Use for:
       a. More native LangGraph integration
       b. More transparent for debugging and tracing

    For memory optimization, you can specify input_states to pass only specific keys to branches.
    This is especially useful when the state is large but branches only need specific parts of it.
    If input_states is None (default), all state keys will be passed.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for this pipeline step.
        branches (list[BasePipelineStep | list[BasePipelineStep]]]): The branches to execute in parallel.
        squash (bool): Whether to squash execution into a single node.
            1. If True, uses asyncio.gather() to run branches in parallel. This will create a single node.
            2. If False, uses native LangGraph structures for parallelism. This will create multiple nodes.
        input_states (list[str] | None): Keys from the state that should be passed to branches.
            If None, all state keys will be passed.
        retry_policy (RetryPolicy | None): Configuration for retry behavior using LangGraph's RetryPolicy.
