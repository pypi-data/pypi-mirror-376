class BasePipelineStep(ABC, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    '''The base class for all pipeline steps.

    A pipeline step represents a single operation or task within a larger processing pipeline.
    Each step must implement:
    1. execute() - to perform the actual operation
    2. add_to_graph() - to integrate with the pipeline structure (optional, default implementation provided)

    The default implementation of add_to_graph is suitable for steps that:
    1. Have a single entry point
    2. Have a single exit point
    3. Connect to all previous endpoints

    For more complex graph structures (e.g., conditional branching), steps should override add_to_graph.

    Examples:
        1. Basic Usage:
            ```python
            step = MyCustomStep("my_step")
            ```

        2. Adding Step Level Caching:
            ```python
            step = MyCustomStep(
                "my_step",
                cache_store=cache_store,
                cache_config={"ttl": 1800}
            )

        3. Retry Configuration:
            ```python
            retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=3, backoff_factor=2)
            step = MyCustomStep(
                "my_step",
                retry_config=retry_config
            )
            ```

        4. Error Handling:
            ```python
            step = MyCustomStep(
                "my_step",
                error_handler=error_handler
            )
            ```

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for the pipeline step.
        retry_policy (RetryPolicy | None): Configuration for retry behavior using LangGraph\'s RetryPolicy.
        cache_store ("BaseCache" | None): The cache store used for caching step results, if configured.
        is_cache_enabled (bool): Property indicating whether caching is enabled for this step.

        '''Initializes a new pipeline step.

        Args:
            name (str): A unique identifier for the pipeline step.
            retry_config (RetryConfig | None, optional): Configuration for retry behavior using
                GLLM Core\'s RetryConfig. Defaults to None, in which case no retry config is applied.
                The RetryConfig is automatically converted to LangGraph\'s RetryPolicy when needed for internal use.
                Note that `timeout` is not supported and will be ignored.
            error_handler (BaseStepErrorHandler | None, optional): Strategy to handle errors during execution.
                Defaults to None, in which case the RaiseStepErrorHandler is used.
            cache_store ("BaseCache" | None, optional): The cache store to use for caching step results.
                Defaults to None. If None, no caching will be used.
            cache_config (dict[str, Any] | None, optional): Configuration for the cache store.
                1. key_func: A function to generate cache keys. If None, the cache instance will use its own key
                    function.
                2. name: The name of the cache. If None, the cache instance will use its own key function.
                3. ttl: The time-to-live for the cache. If None, the cache will not have a TTL.
                4. matching_strategy: The strategy for matching cache keys.
                    If None, the cache instance will use "exact".
                5. matching_config: Configuration for the matching strategy.
                    If None, the cache instance will use its own default matching strategy configuration.

        Caching Mechanism:
            When a cache_store is provided, the step\'s execution method is automatically
            wrapped with a cache decorator. This means:
            1. Before execution, the cache is checked for existing results based on input parameters
            2. If a cached result exists and is valid, it\'s returned immediately
            3. If no cached result exists, the step executes normally and the result is cached
            4. Cache keys are generated from the step\'s input state and configuration
            5. The cache name defaults to "step_{step_name}" if not specified
