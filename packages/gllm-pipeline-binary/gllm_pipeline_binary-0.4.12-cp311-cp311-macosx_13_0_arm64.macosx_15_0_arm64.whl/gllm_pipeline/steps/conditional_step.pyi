class ConditionalStep(BaseCompositeStep, HasInputsMixin):
    '''A conditional pipeline step that conditionally executes different branches based on specified conditions.

    This step evaluates one or more conditions and selects a branch to execute based on the result.
    It provides flexibility in defining complex conditional logic within a pipeline.

    A minimal usage requires defining the branches to execute based on a `condition`, which is a callable
    that takes input from the state and returns a string identifying the branch to execute.

    The condition can be a `Component` or a `Callable`. The handling of inputs differs:
    1. If the condition is a `Component`, `input_state_map` and `runtime_config_map` are
      used to map the pipeline\'s state and config to the component\'s inputs.
    2. If the condition is a `Callable`, it receives a merged dictionary of the
      pipeline\'s state and config directly. `input_state_map` and `runtime_config_map`
      are ignored in this case.

    Example:
    ```python
    ConditionalStep(
        name="UseCaseSelection",
        branches={"A": step_a, DEFAULT_BRANCH: step_b},
        condition=lambda x: "A" if "<A>" in x["query"] else "__default__"
    )
    ```
    This will execute `step_a` if the query contains "<A>", and `step_b` otherwise.

    The special key `__default__` (importable as DEFAULT_BRANCH) defines the default branch to execute
    if no other condition matches. If the DEFAULT_BRANCH is not defined and no condition matches,
    the step will raise an error.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for this pipeline step.
        branches (dict[str, BasePipelineStep | list[BasePipelineStep]]): Mapping of condition results to steps.
        condition (list[ConditionType] | None): The condition(s) to evaluate for branch selection.
        input_state_map (dict[str, str] | None): A dictionary mapping the state keys to the component\'s
            input keys. This is only used if the condition is a `Component`. Defaults to None.
        output_state (str | None): Key to store the condition result in the state, if desired.
        condition_aggregator (Callable[[list[Any]], str]): Function to aggregate multiple condition results.
        runtime_config_map (dict[str, str] | None): A dictionary mapping the runtime config keys to the
            component\'s input keys. This is only used if the condition is a `Component`. Defaults to None.
        fixed_args (dict[str, Any] | None): Fixed arguments to be passed to the condition evaluation.
        retry_policy (RetryPolicy | None): Configuration for retry behavior using LangGraph\'s RetryPolicy.
        error_handler (BaseStepErrorHandler | None): Strategy to handle errors during execution.
