class TaskBase(ABC):
    """
    A Task is the interface between processing code and its execution.  Processing code can follow this interface through subclassing remain agnostic to the execution environment.

    Each DAG task must implement its own subclass of this abstract wrapper class.

    Intended instantiation is as a context manager

    >>> class RealTask(TaskBase):
    >>>     def run(self):
    >>>         pass
    >>>
    >>> with RealTask(1, "a", "b") as task:
    >>>     task()

    Task names in airflow are the same as the class name
    Additional methods can be added but will only be called if they are referenced via run,
    pre_run, post_run, or __exit__

    overriding methods other than run, pre_run, post_run, and in special cases __exit__ is
    discouraged as they are used internally to support the abstraction.
    e.g. __init__ is called by the core api without user involvement so adding parameters will not
    result in them being passed in as there is no client interface to __init__.

    To use the apm infrastructure in subclass code one would do the following:

    >>> def foo(self):
    >>>     with self.apm_step("do detailed work"):
    >>>         pass # do work

    Parameters

    workflow_name : str
        name of the workflow to which this instance of the task belongs
    workflow_version : str

        ----------
        name : str
            The name of the span to be created.

        context : Context, optional
            An optional Context containing the span's parent. Defaults to the global context.

        kind : SpanKind, optional
            The span's kind (relationship to parent). Note that is meaningful even if there is no parent.

        attributes : Attributes, optional
            The span's attributes.

        links : Sequence[Link], optional
            Links span to other spans

        start_time : int, optional
            Sets the start time of a span

        record_exception : bool, optional
            Whether to record any exceptions raised within the context as error event on the span.

        set_status_on_exception : bool, optional
            Only relevant if the returned span is used in a with/context manager. Defines whether the span status will
            be automatically set to ERROR when an uncaught exception is raised in the span with block. The span status
            won't be set by this mechanism if it was previously set manually.

            Whether to end the span automatically when leaving the context manager.
