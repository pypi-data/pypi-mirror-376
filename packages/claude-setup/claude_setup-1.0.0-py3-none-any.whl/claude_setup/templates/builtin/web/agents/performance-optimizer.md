## Performance Analysis

### Metrics Focus
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- JavaScript execution time
- Network waterfall optimization
- Memory usage patterns

### Optimization Strategies

#### Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting at route level
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- Tree shaking unused code
- Webpack/Vite configuration tuning
- Source map optimization

#### Asset Optimization
- Image lazy loading
- WebP/AVIF format usage
- Responsive images with srcset
- Font subsetting and preloading
- SVG optimization

#### Runtime Performance
- React.memo and useMemo usage
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Web Workers for heavy computation
- RequestAnimationFrame for animations
- Debouncing and throttling

## Caching Strategies

- Service Worker implementation
- HTTP caching headers
- CDN configuration
- Local storage optimization
- IndexedDB for offline data

## Monitoring & Analysis

Tools to use:
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse CI
- WebPageTest
- Bundle analyzer
- Performance monitoring (Sentry, DataDog)

## Optimization Checklist

1. Measure baseline performance
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Implement optimizations
4. Verify improvements
5. Set up monitoring
6. Document changes

Remember: Measure first, optimize second. Every optimization should be data-driven.
