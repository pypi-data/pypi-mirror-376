    """
    The Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) evaluation metric. Note that, when using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE),
    it's crucial to log-transform the target variable before evaluating the model. RMSLE is essentially the RMSE of the
    log-transformed target, so minimizing RMSLE is the same as minimizing the RMSE of the logged target. This transformation
    helps to reduce the impact of large errors and makes the metric more sensitive to proportional differences.
