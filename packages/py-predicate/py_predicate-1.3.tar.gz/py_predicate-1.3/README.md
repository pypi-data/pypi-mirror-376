# Introduction

py-predicate is a typed Python library to create composable predicates.

These predicates can be used for generating test-cases (property based testing) and
run-time instrumenting of functions against a specification based on predicates.

# Getting started

To get started, install the library with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```
pip install py-predicate
```

The full documentation can be found [here](https://mrijk.github.io/py-predicate/). We give 2 small examples
to show what the library can do.

# Example 1

```python
filtered = [x for x in range(10) if x >= 2 and x <= 3]
```

## Version with predicates:

```python
from predicate import ge_p, le_p

ge_2 = ge_p(2)
le_3 = le_p(3)

between_2_and_3 = ge_2 & le_3
filtered = [x for x in range(10) if between_2_and_3(x)]
```

Of course this example looks way more complicated than the original version. The point here is that you can build
reusable predicates that can be used in multiple locations.

So lets do just that, reuse our predicate to create a generator. The ``generate_false`` will create an infinite
series of integers for which the predicate ``between_2_and_3`` is False. The ``generate_true`` will create an
infinite (well, with lots of duplicates obviously) series of integers for which the predicate is True.

```python
from predicate import generate_false, generate_true, ge_p, le_p
from more_itertools import take

ge_2 = ge_p(2)
le_3 = le_p(3)

between_2_and_3 = ge_2 & le_3

take(5, generate_true(between_2_and_3))

take(5, generate_false(between_2_and_3))
```

This might be useful for example in unit tests.

# Example 2

A unique (?) py-predicate feature is that you can define self referencing predicates.
This makes it easy to apply predicates to arbitrarily nested structures, like JSON data.

In the next example we define a predicate, that tests if a given data structure is
either a string, or a list of data that can again either be a string or a list of
data. Ad infinitum.

```python
from predicate import all_p, is_list_p, is_str_p, root_p

str_or_list_of_str = is_str_p | (is_list_p & all_p(root_p))
```

Using plain Python, the above one-liner would have to be coded as a (recursive) function.
