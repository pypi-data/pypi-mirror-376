*High-level Python object representation of eveH5 file contents.*

    .. contents::
        :local:
        :depth: 1

This module provides a high-level representation of the contents of an eveH5
file. Being a high-level, user-facing object representation, technically
speaking this module is a facade. The corresponding resource
(persistence-layer-facing interface) would be the :mod:`eveh5
<evefile.boundaries.eveh5>` module.


Overview
========

A first overview of the classes implemented in this module and their
hierarchy is given in the UML diagram below.


.. figure:: /uml/evefile.boundaries.evefile.*
    :align: center

    Class hierarchy of the :mod:`evefile.boundaries.evefile` module,
    providing the facade (user-facing interface) for an eveH5 file.
    Basically, it inherits from :class:`evefile.entities.file.File`
    and adds behaviour. Most of this behaviour is contributed by the various
    modules of the :mod:`controllers <evefile.controllers>`
    subpackage.


Key aspects
===========

While the :mod:`evefile <evefile.boundaries.evefile>` module is the
high-level interface (facade) of the ``evefile`` package,
it is still, from a functional viewpoint, close to the actual eveH5 files,
providing a faithful representation of all information contained in an eveH5
file. Nevertheless, it is clearly an abstraction from the actual data files.
Hence, the key characteristics of the module are:

* Stable interface to eveH5 files, regardless of their version.

  * Some features may only be available for newer eveH5 versions, though.

* Powerful abstractions on the device level.

  * Options to devices appear as attributes of the device objects, not as
    separate datasets.

* Actual **data are loaded on demand**, not when loading the file.

  * This does *not* apply to the metadata of the individual datasets.
    Those are read upon reading the file.
  * Reading data on demand should save time and resources, particularly
    for larger files.
  * Often, you are only interested in a subset of the available data.


Usage
=====

Loading the contents of a data file of a measurement may be as simple as:

.. code-block::

    evefile = EveFile(filename="my_measurement_file.h5")

If you are interested in a convenient overview of the contents of the
eveH5 file just loaded, try this:

.. code-block::

    evefile.show_info()

This will output a human-readable summary of the file metadata,
log messages, and a list of datasets in the data, snapshot, and monitor
section. See the documentation of the :meth:`EveFile.show_info` method for
details.

Data are stored within a :class:`EveFile` object with their IDs rather than
the "given" names users are familiar with. Hence, to get an overview of all
the data(sets) contained in a file, use the :meth:`EveFile.get_data_names`
method:

.. code-block::

    evefile.get_data_names()

This will return a list of "given" data names.

Similarly, if you know the "given" name of a dataset or a list of datasets,
you can retrieve the corresponding :class:`Data <evefile.entities.data.Data>`
objects by using the :meth:`EveFile.get_data` method:

.. code-block::

    # Get list of datasets by name
    evefile.get_data(["name1", "name2"])

    # Get single dataset by name
    evefile.get_data("name")

To get the data marked as preferred in the scan, use the
:meth:`EveFile.get_preferred_data` method:

.. code-block::

    evefile.get_preferred_data()

This will return a list with three elements, ``[preferred_axis,
preferred_channel, preferred_normalisation_channel]``, where each of these
elements is either of type :class:`evefile.entities.data.Data` or
:obj:`None`.


Internals: What happens when reading an eveH5 file?
===================================================

Reading an eveH5 file is not as simple as reading contents of an HDF5 file
and present its contents as Python object hierarchy. At least, if you would
like to view, process, and analyse your data more conveniently, you should
not stop here. The idea behind the ``evefile`` package, and in parts behind
the :class:`EveFile` class, is to provide you as consumer of the data with
powerful abstractions and structured information. To this end, a series of
steps are necessary:

* Read the eveH5 file (actually, an HDF5 file).
* Get the correct :class:`VersionMapper
  <evefile.controllers.version_mapping.VersionMapper>` class.
* Map the file contents to the proper :mod:`data structures
  <evefile.entities.data>` provided by the ``evefile`` package.

class EveFile(File):
    """
    High-level Python object representation of eveH5 file contents.

    This class serves as facade to the entire ``evefile`` package and provides
    a rather high-level representation of the contents of an individual
    eveH5 file.

    Individual measurements are saved in HDF5 files using a particular
    schema (eveH5). Besides file-level metadata, there are log messages
    and the actual data.

    The data are organised in three functionally different sections: data,
    snapshots, and monitors. While the "data" section contains the data of
    motor axes moved and detector channels read out during the scan,
    the "snapshot" section contains values at distinct times (usually at
    the very beginning of a scan), usually of more devices than used in
    the scan. The "monitors" section contains data of all those devices
    monitored during the scan, meaning that only changes in values are
    recorded, together with their timestamp (rather than position count).

    Values from axes contained in the "snapshot" section are used for data
    joining, while all other values can be regarded as either options
    of individual devices or telemetry data for the setup. All values from
    the "monitors" section are strictly telemetry data for the setup.


    Attributes
    ----------
    metadata : :class:`evefile.entities.file.Metadata`
        File metadata

    log_messages : :class:`list`
        Log messages from an individual measurement

        Each item in the list is an instance of
        :class:`evefile.entities.file.LogMessage`.

    data : :class:`dict`
        Data recorded from the devices involved in the scan.

        The keys of the dictionary are the (guaranteed to be unique) HDF
        dataset names, not the "given" names usually familiar to the users.
        Use the :meth:`get_data` method to retrieve data objects by their
        "given" name.

        Each item is an instance of
        :class:`evefile.entities.data.Data`.

    snapshots : :class:`dict`
        Device data recorded as snapshot during a measurement.

        Only those device data that are not options belonging to any of
        the devices in the :attr:`data` attribute are stored here.

        The keys of the dictionary are the (guaranteed to be unique) HDF
        dataset names, not the "given" names usually familiar to the users.

        Each item is an instance of
        :class:`evefile.entities.data.Data`.

    monitors : :class:`dict`
        Device data monitored during a measurement.

        The keys of the dictionary are the (guaranteed to be unique) HDF
        dataset names, not the "given" names usually familiar to the users.

        **Please note:** For monitors, in contrast to data stored in the
        :attr:`data` attribute, names are *not unique*. Hence, the only way to
        address an individual monitor unequivocally is by its ID that is
        identical to the HDF dataset name.

        Each item is an instance of
        :class:`evefile.entities.data.MonitorData`.

    position_timestamps : :class:`evefile.entities.data.TimestampData`
        Timestamps for each individual position.

        Monitors have timestamps (milliseconds since start of the scan)
        rather than positions as primary quantisation axis. This object
        provides a mapping between timestamps and positions and can be used
        to map monitor data to positions.


    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : :class:`str`
        Name of the file to be loaded.


    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if no filename is provided.

        Retrieve monitors as mapped device data objects by ID.

        While you can get the original monitor data objects by accessing the
        :attr:`monitors <evefile.entities.file.File.monitors>` attribute
        directly, there, they are stored as
        :obj:`MonitorData <evefile.entities.data.MonitorData>` objects with
        timestamps instead of position counts. To relate monitors to the
        measured data, the former need to be mapped to position counts.

        .. note::

            Monitors, in contrast to data objects stored in the
            :attr:`data <evefile.entities.file.File.data>` attribute,
            have *no unique names*. Hence, the only way to unequivocally
            access a given monitor (or the respective, mapped
            :obj:`DeviceData <evefile.entities.data.DeviceData>` object) is
            by means of its unique ID.


        Parameters
        ----------
        monitors : :class:`str` | :class:`list`
            Name or list of names of monitors to retrieve

        -------
        device_data : :class:`evefile.entities.data.Data` | :class:`list`
            Device data object(s) corresponding to the ID(s).

            In case of a list of data objects, each object is of type

        """
        Retrieve Pandas DataFrame with snapshots as rows.

        Snapshots serve generally two functions:

        #. Provide base values for axes.

           In case of joining data using :meth:`get_joined_data`, for axes,
           typically the previous values are used for positions no axes
           values have been recorded. Snapshots are used if available.

        #. Provide telemetry data for the setup the data were recorded with.

           Snapshots regularly contain many more parameters than motor axes
           used and detector channels recorded. Generally, this provides a
           lot of telemetry data regarding the setup used for recording the
           data.

        The first function is served by the :meth:`get_joined_data` method
        automatically. The second function can be served by having a look at
        a summary containing all snapshot data. This is the aim of this
        method: returning a Pandas DataFrame containing all snapshots as
        rows and the position counts as columns.


        Returns
        -------
        snapshot_dataframe : :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            Pandas DataFrame containing all snapshots as rows.

            The indices (names of the rows) are the names (not IDs) of the
