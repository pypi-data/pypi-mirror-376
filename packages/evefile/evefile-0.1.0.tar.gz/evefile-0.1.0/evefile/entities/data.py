Data are organised in "datasets" within HDF5, and the
:mod:`evefile.entities.data` module provides the relevant entities
to describe these datasets.

Please note that in contrast to the `evedata
<https://evedata.docs.radiometry.de/>`_ package, the ``evefile`` package has
a somewhat reduced data model, *e.g.* not considering individual data points
for average and interval channels (that are currently not available from the
underlying data files, anyway). Whether the corresponding module in the
``evedata`` package will become a true superset of this module remains to be
seen.


Overview
========

A first overview of the classes implemented in this module and their
hierarchy is given in the UML diagram below, :numref:`Fig. %s
<fig-uml_evefile.data_api>`. The first distinction is made
between :class:`MonitorData` and :class:`MeasureData`, with the former
having timestamps (in milliseconds) as their quantisation axis, and the
latter individual positions (integer values). :class:`MeasureData` can
further be separated into :class:`AxisData`, :class:`ChannelData`,
and :class:`DeviceData`. The :class:`TimestampData` class is somewhat
special, as it (only) gets used to map timestamps to positions and does
not correspond to any physical device or option of such device. Generally,
each data class comes with its corresponding metadata class implemented in
the :mod:`evefile.entities.metadata` module.

    Class hierarchy of the :mod:`evefile.entities.data` module.
    Each class has a corresponding metadata class in the
    :mod:`evefile.entities.metadata` module. While in this
    diagram, some child classes seem to be identical, they have a
    different type of metadata (see the
    :mod:`evefile.entities.metadata` module). Generally, having
    different types serves to discriminate where necessary between
    detector channels and motor axes.

Individual classes
------------------

The following is not a strict inheritance hierarchy, but rather a grouped
hierarchical list of classes for quick access to their individual API
documentation:

* :class:`Data`

  * :class:`MonitorData`
  * :class:`MeasureData`

    * :class:`DeviceData`
    * :class:`TimestampData`
    * :class:`AxisData`
    * :class:`ChannelData`

      * :class:`SinglePointChannelData`

        * :class:`SinglePointNormalizedChannelData`

      * :class:`AverageChannelData`

        * :class:`AverageNormalizedChannelData`

      * :class:`IntervalChannelData`

        * :class:`IntervalNormalizedChannelData`



Special aspects
===============

There is a number of special aspects that need to be taken into account
when reading data. These are detailed below.


Sorting non-monotonic positions
-------------------------------

For :class:`MeasureData`, positions ("PosCounts") need not be
monotonically increasing. This is due to the way the engine handles the
different scan modules and writes data. However, this will usually be a
problem for the analysis. Therefore, positions need to be sorted
monotonically, and this is done during data import.


Handling duplicate positions
----------------------------

Although technically speaking a bug, some (older) measurement files
contain duplicate positions ("PosCounts"). Here, the handling is different
for :class:`AxisData` and :class:`ChannelData`, but in both cases taken
care of during data import:

* For :class:`AxisData`, only the *last* position is taken.
* For :class:`ChannelData`, only the *first* position is taken.

class Data:
    """
    Data recorded from the devices involved in a measurement.

    This is the base class for all data(sets) and not meant to be used
    directly. Rather, one of the individual subclasses should actually be
    used.

    When subclassing, make sure to create the corresponding metadata class
    in the :mod:`evefile.entities.metadata` module as well.

    Data are read from HDF5 files, and to save time and resources, actual
    data are only read upon request.

    Attributes
    ----------
    metadata : :class:`evefile.entities.metadata.Metadata`
        Relevant metadata for the individual device.

    options : :class:`dict`
        (Variable) options of the device.

        Devices can have options. Generally, there are two types of
        options: those whose values are *not* changing within a given scan
        module, and those whose values can potentially change for every
        individual position (count). The latter are stored here as
        key--value pairs with the key corresponding to the option name.
        The former are stored in the
        :attr:`evefile.entities.metadata.Metadata.options` attribute.

    importer : :class:`list`
        Importer objects for the data and possibly (variable) options.

        Each item is a :obj:`DataImporter` object.

        Data are loaded on demand, not already when initially loading the
        eveH5 file. Hence, the need for a mechanism to provide the relevant
        information where to get the relevant data from and how. Different
        versions of the underlying eveH5 schema differ even in whether all
        data belonging to one :obj:`Data` object are located in one HDF5
        dataset or spread over multiple HDF5 datasets. In the latter case,
        individual importers are necessary for the separate HDF5 datasets.
        Hence, the list of importers.

    Examples
    --------
    The :class:`Data` class is not meant to be used directly, as any
    entities, but rather indirectly by means of the respective facades in
    the boundaries technical layer of the ``evefile`` package.
    Hence, for the time being, there are no dedicated examples how to use
    this class. Of course, you can instantiate an object as usual.

    Optionally, preprocessing will be applied to the data loaded, if the
    list :attr:`preprocessing` is not empty.


    Attributes
    ----------
    source : :class:`str`
        Source the data should be loaded from.

        Typically, a file name.

    preprocessing : :class:`list`
        Preprocessing steps applied after loading the original data.

        Each entry in the list is an object of type
        :class:`ImporterPreprocessingStep`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

    Load data from HDF5 dataset.

    HDF5 files are organised hierarchically, with groups as nodes and
    datasets as leafs. Data can (only) be contained in datasets, and this is
    what this importer is concerned about.

    .. note::
        Perhaps it is possible to move this class to the boundary technical
        layer, by means of creating an (abstract) DataImporterFactory in the
        entities layer and a concrete factory in the boundary layer. The
        only complication currently: the controller technical layer needs to
        access the concrete DataImporterFactory.


    Attributes
    ----------
    source : :class:`str`
        Source the data should be loaded from.

        Name of an HDF5 file.

    item : :class:`str`
        The dataset within the HDF5 file.

        Datasets are addressed by a path-like string, with slashes
        separating the hierarchy levels in the file.

    mapping : :class:`dict`
        Mapping table for table columns to :obj:`Data` object attributes.

        HDF5 datasets in eveH5 files usually consist of at least two columns
        for their data, the first either the position or the time since
        start of the measurement in milliseconds. Besides this, there can be
        more than one additional column for the actual data. As the
        structure of the datasets changed and will change, there is a need
        for a mapping table that gets filled properly by the
        :class:`VersionMapper
        <evefile.controllers.version_mapping.VersionMapper>` class.

        Furthermore, storing this mapping information is relevant as data
        are usually only loaded upon request, not preliminary, to save time
        and resources.

    data : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        Data loaded from the HDF5 dataset.

        The actual data type (:class:`numpy.dtype`) depends on the
        specific dataset loaded.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised upon load if either source or item are not provided.


    Examples
    --------
    To import data from an HDF5 dataset located in an HDF5 file, you need to
    provide both, file name (source) and dataset name (item):

    .. code-block::
