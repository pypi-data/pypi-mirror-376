## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a biomedical engineer working with radiology reports, I want to use an intuitive tool that can intelligently "extract" whatever I need from reports - whether that's structured data, summaries, or insights - with minimal cognitive overhead. When I have multiple fragmented reports representing a patient's history, I want the system to intelligently synthesize them into a comprehensive summary highlighting the important progression, findings, and clinical significance. The system should have intuitive commands and provide results in a clear, engaging way.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** only a PDF radiology report, **When** I run `mosaicx extract report.pdf`, **Then** the system intelligently determines whether I need structured data or a summary and delivers it with clear terminal output and progress indicators
2. **Given** a text radiology report, **When** I run `mosaicx extract report.txt --style summary`, **Then** I receive a well-formatted summary with key insights highlighted and clear visual presentation
3. **Given** I want custom structured output, **When** I run `mosaicx extract report.pdf --style structured --schema my_schema.yaml`, **Then** I get data organized exactly according to my defined schema with clear validation feedback
4. **Given** I don't have a predefined schema, **When** I run `mosaicx extract report.pdf --style structured --interactive`, **Then** the system engages me in a guided conversation to collaboratively design the optimal schema for my needs
5. **Given** multiple reports with the same schema, **When** I run `mosaicx extract *.pdf --schema radiology_standard.json --batch`, **Then** I see consistent structured output across all reports with clear progress displays
6. **Given** I'm using MOSAICX as a library and want interactive schema building, **When** I call `mosaicx.build_schema_interactive(report, callback=my_input_handler)`, **Then** the system calls my callback function with questions and options, allowing programmatic interaction
7. **Given** I'm using MOSAICX as a library without interactive capability, **When** I call `mosaicx.suggest_schema(report)`, **Then** I receive an auto-generated schema suggestion that I can modify and use for extraction
8. **Given** multiple fragmented reports from a patient's history, **When** I run `mosaicx extract patient_reports/*.pdf --style patient-summary`, **Then** the system intelligently synthesizes all reports into a comprehensive timeline summary highlighting disease progression, key findings, and clinical significance
9. **Given** a collection of reports and custom aggregation rules, **When** I run `mosaicx extract reports/*.pdf --style multi-report --schema timeline_schema.yaml`, **Then** I receive structured data showing progression patterns, recurring findings, and comparative analysis across the report series
10. **Given** I'm using the library for patient history analysis, **When** I call `mosaicx.analyze_patient_history(reports_list, focus="progression")`, **Then** I receive an intelligent synthesis highlighting temporal patterns, evolving conditions, and clinical significance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system can't decide between summary or structured extraction and wants to have fun asking the user?
- How does the system handle user-defined schemas that are impossible to fill from the available report data?
- What occurs when users want to extract something unusual and the system needs to be creative with schema suggestions?
- How does the interactive schema builder handle users who aren't sure what fields they want in CLI vs library contexts?
- How does the library handle interactive schema building when no callback function is provided?
- What happens when callback functions in library mode don't respond or provide invalid input?
- How does the system validate and suggest improvements to user-defined schemas while keeping it fun?
- What happens when local LLM services are slow and the system needs to entertain the user during schema processing?
- How does the system handle conflicting field definitions in custom schemas and make resolution enjoyable?
- How does the system intelligently handle temporal ordering when report dates are missing or unclear?
- What happens when multi-report analysis encounters conflicting findings across different time points?
- How does the system handle incomplete patient histories where some reports may be missing?
- How does the patient history synthesis maintain clinical accuracy while providing engaging summaries?
