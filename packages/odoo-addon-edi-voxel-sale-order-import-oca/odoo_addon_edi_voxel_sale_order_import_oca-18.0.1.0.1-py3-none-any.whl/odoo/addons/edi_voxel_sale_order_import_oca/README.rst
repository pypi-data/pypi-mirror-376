This module allows you to import sales orders from Voxel. Imports are
queued in jobs running in the background.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module you have to belong to the access group 'Voxel
manager' under 'Technical Settings', then:

1. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Companies*, open the companies
   you want to enable Voxel communication and set 'Enable Voxel' field
   to True.
2. In the login list, add the corresponding login for connecting with
   Voxel to import sales orders. The final URL from where sales order
   will be imported is '<Login URL>/Outbox'.
3. Save the form and edit it again, find 'Sale Order login' field and
   select the login to be used in the imports.
4. If you have the right access, go to *Settings > Technical >
   Automation > Scheduled Actions*, find the record named 'Edi Voxel:
   Get voxel sale order' and Adjust the data corresponding to that
   scheduled action, such as the frequency with which that action will
   be executed.

Note:

This module enqueue the imports in jobs in the background. To do that it
uses queue_job module, so a configuration is required according to that.
The jobs for imports are queued in the channel ``root.voxel_import``.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you don't need to do anything. Automatically every
so often a 'scheduled action' will be executed that will try to import
from Voxel the sales orders that have not been imported previously.

Imports will be performed for the companies that have the 'Voxel' field
checked (See configuration section).
