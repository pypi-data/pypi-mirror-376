## Installation

### Windows

The easiest way to get started on Windows is to download the latest installer from our
**[releases page](https://github.com/barebaric/rayforge/releases/)**.

### Linux

We offer several installation methods for Linux.

#### Ubuntu & Derivatives (via PPA)

For users on Ubuntu and its derivatives (like Linux Mint, Pop!_OS), the recommended method is our official PPA. This integrates directly with your system's package manager and provides automatic updates.

> [!NOTE]
> The PPA supports **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and newer**.

Open a terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:knipknap/rayforge
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rayforge
```

#### Cross-Distro (Recommended via Snap)

For other Linux distributions, or if you prefer a sandboxed application, the recommended method is installing via the Snap Store. It includes all necessary dependencies in a single package.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/en/light/install.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rayforge)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To grant the application access to your camera and serial port, run the
> following commands once after installation!

```bash
sudo snap connect rayforge:camera
```

If you want to be able to use USB Serial connections, you need to to the following:

1. Update to the latest Rayforge edge release.
2. Plug your laser into a USB port.
3. Open a terminal
4. Execute `sudo snap set system experimental.hotplug=true`
5. Execute `sudo snap connect rayforge:serial-port`. This will fail if your laser is not connected via USB!
6. Start Rayforge

#### Advanced: From Source (via PIP)

For advanced users who prefer not to use Snap or a PPA, Rayforge can be installed via PIP.
You will need to manually install system dependencies first. On Debian/Ubuntu-based
systems, this can be done with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-adw-1 gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0 libgirepository-1.0-dev libgirepository-2.0-0 libvips42t64 libpotrace-dev libagg-dev libadwaita-1-0 libopencv-dev

pip3 install rayforge
```

_(Note: Package names may differ slightly on other distributions.)_

### Other Operating Systems (e.g., macOS)

While there are no official installers for other operating systems at this time,
Rayforge is built with cross-platform code. It may be possible to install it from
source using the PIP instructions above. Contributions for packaging on other
platforms are welcome!

## Development

This project uses [**Pixi**](https://pixi.sh/) to manage dependencies and development environments.
It provides a single, cross-platform tool for a reproducible setup.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Pixi installed on your system. You can find the installation instructions
on the [official website](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/).

### 1. Initial Setup

After cloning the repository, setting up the development environment should work with this command:

```bash
sudo apt install gir1.2-adw-1
pixi install
```

This will read the `pixi.toml` file, create a local `.pixi` environment,
and install all specified conda and pypi dependencies in it.

### 2. Running the Application

To run the main application, use the `run` task defined in `pixi.toml`:

```bash
pixi run rayforge
```

### 3. Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the `test` task:

```bash
pixi run test
```

### 4. Working in the Activated Environment

For a more interactive workflow (similar to activating a virtual environment), you can start a shell within the project's environment:

```bash
pixi shell
```

Now, your shell is configured with all the project's dependencies. You can run commands directly without the `pixi run` prefix:

```bash
# Inside the pixi shell
rayforge
pytest -v
```

Exit the shell by typing `exit`.

### 5. Managing Dependencies

The `pixi.toml` file is the single source of truth for all dependencies. Do not use `pip` or `conda` directly to add packages.

**To add a new Conda package:**

```bash
# Example: Add numpy from conda-forge
pixi add numpy
```

**To add a new PyPI package:**

```bash
# Example: Add requests from PyPI
pixi add --pypi requests
```

Pixi will automatically resolve the dependencies and update the `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock` files.

### 6. Translation Workflow

The following tasks are available for managing language translations:

*   **To extract new strings from the code and update `.po` files:**
    ```bash
    pixi run update-translations
    ```

*   **To compile `.po` files into `.mo` files for the application to use:**
    ```bash
    pixi run compile-translations
    ```
