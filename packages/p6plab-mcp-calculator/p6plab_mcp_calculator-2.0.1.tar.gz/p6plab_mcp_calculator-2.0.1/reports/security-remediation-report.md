# Security Remediation Report

**Date**: 2025-09-06  
**Project**: Scientific Calculator MCP Server  
**Security Scanner**: Bandit v1.7.0+

## Summary

- **High Severity Issues**: 1 (FIXED)
- **Medium Severity Issues**: 0
- **Low Severity Issues**: 5 (DOCUMENTED - ACCEPTABLE)

## High Severity Issues (FIXED)

### Issue 1: Use of weak MD5 hash for security (B324)
**Location**: `calculator/utils/helpers.py:438`  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Description**: MD5 hash was used for cache key generation  
**Remediation**: Replaced MD5 with SHA-256 for better security practices  

**Before**:
```python
return hashlib.md5(key_string.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**After**:
```python
# Use SHA-256 instead of MD5 for better security practices
return hashlib.sha256(key_string.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Impact**: No functional impact, improved security posture

## Low Severity Issues (ACCEPTABLE)

All Low severity issues are related to "Try, Except, Pass detected" (B110) in mathematical computation contexts where graceful error handling is appropriate.

### Issue 1: Try, Except, Pass in symbolic root solving
**Location**: `calculator/core/solver.py:536`  
**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE  
**Justification**: Mathematical root finding may encounter edge cases (complex numbers, infinite values) where graceful fallback to numerical methods is appropriate  

### Issue 2: Try, Except, Pass in symbolic root solving  
**Location**: `calculator/core/solver.py:538`  
**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE  
**Justification**: Part of multi-method root finding algorithm with graceful degradation from symbolic to numerical methods  

### Issue 3: Try, Except, Pass in numerical root finding
**Location**: `calculator/core/solver.py:581`  
**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE  
**Justification**: Numerical root finding algorithms may fail for certain mathematical expressions; graceful handling prevents crashes  

### Issue 4: Try, Except, Pass in equation solving
**Location**: `calculator/core/solver.py:615`  
**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE  
**Justification**: Mathematical equation solving with multiple fallback strategies; silent failures allow algorithm to try alternative approaches  

### Issue 5: Try, Except, Pass in polynomial coefficient extraction
**Location**: `calculator/core/solver.py:699`  
**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE  
**Justification**: Polynomial coefficient extraction may fail for certain symbolic expressions; graceful handling maintains algorithm robustness  

## Security Posture Assessment

### ✅ Strengths
- No High or Medium severity security issues remain
- Strong input validation using Pydantic models
- Proper error handling in user-facing APIs
- Secure mathematical expression parsing using SymPy
- No use of dangerous functions like `eval()` or `exec()`
- External API access disabled by default (currency conversion)

### ℹ️ Low Risk Areas
- Mathematical computation algorithms use try-except-pass for graceful degradation
- All instances are in internal mathematical computation, not user input handling
- Proper error reporting maintained at API level

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
1. ✅ Fixed MD5 usage in cache key generation
2. ✅ Verified no High/Medium severity issues remain
3. ✅ Documented Low severity issues with justifications

### Ongoing Security Practices
1. **Regular Security Scans**: Continue running bandit in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep security scanning tools updated
3. **Code Review**: Include security considerations in code reviews
4. **Input Validation**: Maintain strict input validation at API boundaries
5. **Error Handling**: Continue proper error handling at user-facing interfaces

## Compliance Status

✅ **COMPLIANT**: Only Low severity issues remain, all with proper justification  
✅ **DEPLOYMENT READY**: No blocking security issues  
✅ **PRODUCTION READY**: Security posture meets requirements  

## Next Security Review

**Recommended**: After any major code changes or dependency updates  
**Required**: Before next major release  
**Automated**: Continuous scanning in CI/CD pipeline
