# Requirements Document - Calculator Codebase Refactoring

## Introduction

The Scientific Calculator MCP Server codebase has grown to 13,844 lines of code with comprehensive mathematical capabilities. While functionally robust, the current architecture suffers from several maintainability and scalability issues including a monolithic server.py file (2,615 lines), repetitive patterns, and scattered configuration management. This refactoring initiative aims to improve code quality, maintainability, performance, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining backward compatibility.
