# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Scientific Calculator MCP Server currently registers 40 tools across 11 groups but needs to reach the target of 68 tools as specified in the project steering document for version v1.0.1. Analysis shows that the system originally had 68 tools defined in the tool group registry, but only 4 services have proper tool registration methods implemented. The other 7 services are using placeholder implementations that delegate to existing services, causing 28 tools to not be registered. This expansion focuses on implementing the missing tool registration methods to restore the original 68 tools.

## Current State Analysis

**Currently Registered (40 tools):**
- Arithmetic: ~24 tools (via register_arithmetic_handlers)
- Matrix: 6 tools (via _register_matrix_tools)
- Statistics: 6 tools (via _register_statistics_tools) 
- Calculus: 4 tools (via _register_calculus_tools)

**Missing (28 tools):**
- Complex: 6 tools (using arithmetic placeholder)
- Units: 7 tools (using arithmetic placeholder)
- Solver: 6 tools (using calculus placeholder)
- Financial: 7 tools (using arithmetic placeholder)
- Currency: 4 tools (using arithmetic placeholder)
- Constants: 3 tools (using arithmetic placeholder)
- Advanced: 5 tools (missing registration method)
