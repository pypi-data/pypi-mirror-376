```

### Script Execution Order

**Development**:
1. `clean.sh` (optional)
2. `dev/run-tests.sh` (quick validation)
3. `dev/validate-refactoring.py` (comprehensive validation)

**CI/CD**:
1. `ci/run-all-tests.sh` (comprehensive testing)
2. `ci/test-production-readiness.sh` (production validation)

**Release**:
1. `update-version.sh` (version management)
2. `deployment/validate-release.sh` (release validation)
3. `deployment/deploy-pipeline.sh test` (test deployment)
4. `deployment/deploy-pipeline.sh production` (production deployment)

## Best Practices

### Script Usage Guidelines

1. **Development**: Use `dev/` scripts for quick feedback during development
2. **CI/CD**: Use `ci/` scripts for comprehensive validation in pipelines
3. **Deployment**: Use `deployment/` scripts for package management and publishing
4. **Monitoring**: Use `monitoring/` scripts for performance analysis
5. **Maintenance**: Use root-level utilities for cleanup and version management

### Error Handling

All scripts implement consistent error handling:
- Exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for failure
- Colored output for better visibility
- Detailed error messages with troubleshooting tips
- Cleanup on failure where appropriate

### Logging and Output

Scripts use consistent logging patterns:
- `✅` for success messages
- `❌` for error messages  
- `⚠️` for warnings
- `ℹ️` for informational messages
- `📋` for step indicators

### Performance Considerations

- Scripts use shared utilities to reduce duplication
- Parallel execution where possible (e.g., in `run-all-tests.sh`)
- Efficient cleanup and artifact management
- Caching of expensive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied**: Run `chmod +x scripts/path/to/script.sh`
2. **Virtual Environment**: Scripts will auto-activate `venv` if available
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Scripts auto-install required dependencies
4. **Path Issues**: All scripts use relative paths from project root

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output for troubleshooting:
```bash
# For shell scripts
bash -x ./scripts/path/to/script.sh

# For Python scripts
CALCULATOR_DEBUG_MODE=true ./scripts/path/to/script.py
```

### Getting Help

- Check script output for troubleshooting tips
- Review logs in `test-results/` directory
- Check security reports in `reports/` directory
- Refer to individual script documentation in source code
