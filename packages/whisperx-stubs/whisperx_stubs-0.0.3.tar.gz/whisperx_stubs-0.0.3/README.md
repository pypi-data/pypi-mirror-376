# whisperx-stubs

Type stubs for the [whisperx](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) library. Note, I do not own the whisperx project. This is just a types folder to make it easier to work with whisperx.

This package provides type information that can be used by static type checkers like mypy, pyright, and IDEs to provide better code completion and type checking for whisperx.

## Installation

```bash
pip install whisperx-stubs
```

## Usage

Once installed, your type checker should automatically discover and use these stubs when analyzing code that uses whisperx.
