- **magnitude**: Quantifies the importance/significance of each sample
- **anomaly_score**: Measures deviation from normal patterns (0-1 scale)
- **context_relevance**: Domain-specific contextual importance (0-1 scale)
- **urgency**: Time-sensitive priority level (0-1 scale)

### 3. Ground Truth Labels
- Binary classification targets for algorithm validation
- Labels created based on domain-specific criteria
- Balanced representation of positive/negative cases where appropriate

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. CSV File Format
All datasets are provided in standard CSV format with headers:
```csv
magnitude,anomaly_score,context_relevance,urgency,feature1,feature2,...,ground_truth
50.2,0.75,0.85,0.6,25.4,1,120,0
...
```

### 2. Loading Data
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/raw/uci_heart_disease.csv')

# Separate Sundew features from domain features
sundew_features = ['magnitude', 'anomaly_score', 'context_relevance', 'urgency']
target = 'ground_truth'
domain_features = [col for col in df.columns if col not in sundew_features + [target]]
```

### 3. Preprocessing Recommendations
- **Sundew features**: Already normalized to appropriate ranges, no scaling needed
- **Domain features**: May require standardization depending on algorithm requirements
- **Ground truth**: Binary labels ready for classification

### 4. Validation Splits
Recommended train/validation/test splits:
- Training: 60%
- Validation: 20%
- Testing: 20%
