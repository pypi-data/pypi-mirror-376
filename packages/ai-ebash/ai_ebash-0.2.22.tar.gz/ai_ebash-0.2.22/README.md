# Ai-ebash!

Console utility for integrating artificial intelligence into a Linux terminal. Allows you to ask an AI question and execute the scripts and commands suggested by the AI in the terminal. It will be useful for novice Linux administrators.

The project is in the pre-alpha stage. In case of problems with the installation or operation of the Ai-bash utility, please contact me.

## Features

- Send chat-style prompts to an LLM (configurable model and endpoint).
- Parse Markdown responses and highlight/number fenced `code` blocks.
- Interactive selection and (optional) execution of code blocks.
- Rich console output via `rich`.
- Configurable via `config.yaml`.

## Security

Do NOT execute arbitrary code returned by an LLM without review. Executing assistant-provided code has security and safety risks. Recommended mitigations:

## Contributing
