    """
    Attempts to acquire a lock using exponential backoff with jitter.

    This function repeatedly attempts to acquire the given lock without blocking.
    If the lock is not immediately available, it waits for a delay period that increases
    exponentially with each attempt, plus a random jitter to reduce contention. The process
    continues until the lock is acquired or the total elapsed time exceeds the specified timeout.

    Args:
        lock (threading.Lock): The lock instance to acquire.
        timeout (float): The total time (in seconds) to keep trying to acquire the lock.
        initial_delay (float, optional): The initial delay (in seconds) before retrying after a failed attempt. Defaults to 0.1.
        factor (int, optional): The multiplier for the delay after each failed attempt. Defaults to 2.
        max_delay (int, optional): The maximum delay (in seconds) between retries. Defaults to 2.
        jitter (float, optional): The maximum additional random delay (in seconds) added to each sleep interval. Defaults to 0.1.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the lock was acquired within the timeout period, otherwise False.
