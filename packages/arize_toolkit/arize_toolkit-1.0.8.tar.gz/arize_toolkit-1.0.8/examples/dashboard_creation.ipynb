    "# Creating Model Volume Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to create a dashboard with model volume widgets using the Arize Toolkit. The dashboard will display prediction volume metrics for all models in your space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this example does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sets up the client**: Connects to your Arize organization and space using environment variables\n",
    "2. **Creates a dashboard**: Generates a new dashboard with a descriptive name\n",
    "3. **Adds volume widgets**: Automatically creates line chart widgets for each model showing prediction volume over time\n",
    "4. **Returns the URL**: Provides the direct link to view your new dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic model detection**: Finds all models in your space and creates widgets for each one\n",
    "- **Volume metrics**: Shows prediction count over time for monitoring model usage\n",
    "- **Production environment**: Focuses on production model data by default\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Gracefully skips models that can't be monitored or have issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## This is useful for:\n",
    "- Monitoring model usage patterns\n",
    "- Identifying which models are most active\n",
    "- Creating operational dashboards for model observability\n",
    "- Tracking prediction volume trends over time"
