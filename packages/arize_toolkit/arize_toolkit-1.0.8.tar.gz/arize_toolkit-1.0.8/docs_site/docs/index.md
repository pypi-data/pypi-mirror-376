It is a open source project developed and maintained by an Arize Engineer. Feel free to add issues or reach out for help in the Arize community Slack channel.

## Overview

Arize Toolkit is a set of tools packaged as a Python client that lets you easily interact with Arize AI APIs.
Here's a quick overview of the main features in the current release:

- Access and manage models
- Retrieve performance metrics over a time period
- Retrieve inference volume over a time period
- Create, copy, and manage custom metrics
- Create, copy, and manage monitors and alerting
- Work with LLM features like prompts and annotations
- Import data from cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure) and databases (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks)
- Create, update, and delete data import jobs with full lifecycle management

## Installation

```bash
pip install arize_toolkit
```

## Client Setup

The `Client` class is the entrypoint for interacting with the toolkit. It provides maintains the connection information for making requests to the Arize APIs, and offers a wide range of operations for interacting with models, monitors, dashboards, and more.

### API Key

To create a client, you need to provide your Arize API key. Use this reference to [get your API key](https://docs.arize.com/arize/reference/authentication-and-security/api-keys) from the Arize UI.

### Organization and Space

You will also need to provide an `organization` name and `space` name. To give some context, models are scoped to a space, and the space is scoped to an organization. These can be found by navigating to the Arize UI and looking at the upper left path in the `Projects & Models` page. They will be in the format `organization/space`.

For the example below, the organization is `Demo Models` and the space is `Demo Model Manager`.

### For On Prem deployments

For SaaS users, the default API endpoint is always going to be `https://api.arize.com`.
If you are using an on prem deployment of Arize, you will need to provide the `api_url` parameter.
This parameters should just be the base url of your Arize instance.
