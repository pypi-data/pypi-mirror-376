ALL I NEED IS A JOB

Got my education
Sat through graduation
Now I'm ridin' high
Crammed with knowledge
Bye bye , college
Now I'm neat and dressy *
Not like UCSC *
Starting this July
I' ll even wear a tie
I'm all set ---
I' ll succeed ---
There 's only one th i ng I need:

Got my 8 .A.
So I'm O.K.
All I need now is a job
Got my hopes high **
Passed my Nat Sci **
Had professors all around to inspire me
Now all I need is someone to hire me
Three cheers
For my four years
I'm no longer your basic slob
And if they'd say
"You ' re hired ," I'd gladly throw away
Those fat books that they made me read
All I really need
Is a job.
