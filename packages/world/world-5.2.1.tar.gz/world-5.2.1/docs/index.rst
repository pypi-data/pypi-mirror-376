==================================
world -- Look up DNS country codes
==================================

.. currentmodule:: world

This package provides a mapping between top-level domain names and their two
letter ISO_ 3166_ country codes.  This script also knows about many
non-geographic, generic, USA-centric, historical, common usage, and reserved
top-level domains.

Both a command line script called ``world`` and a library called ``world``
are available.  The latter can be imported into your Python code for whatever
application you want.

This script takes a list of Internet top-level domain names and prints out
where in the world those domains originate from.  For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ world tz us
    tz originates from Tanzania, United Republic of
    us originates from United States of America (the)

Reverse look ups are also supported:

.. code-block:: console

    $ world -r united
    Matches for "united":
      ae: United Arab Emirates (the)
      gb: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the)
      tz: Tanzania, United Republic of
      uk: United Kingdom (common practice)
      um: United States Minor Outlying Islands (the)
      us: United States of America (the)

Only two-letter country codes are supported, since these are the only ones that were freely available from the
ISO_ 3166_ standard.  However, as of 2015-01-09, even these are `no longer freely available
<https://gitlab.com/warsaw/world/-/issues/5>`__ in a machine readable format.

``world`` requires Python 3.9 or newer.
