    """
    A context manager to capture logs from one or more specified loggers.

    This function temporarily attaches a thread-safe, queue-based handler to the
    target logger(s) to intercept all log messages. If `disable_console` is True,
    it will also temporarily remove other console-based StreamHandlers from the
    target loggers to prevent duplicate output to the terminal.

    Args:
        log_name: The name of the logger(s) to capture.
                - `str`: Captures logs from a single named logger.
                - `List[str]`: Captures logs from multiple named loggers.
                - `None` or `""`: Captures logs from the root logger.
        log_level: The minimum level of logs to capture (e.g., `logging.INFO`).
        disable_console: If True, prevents the captured logs from also being
                        printed to the console by other handlers on the same logger.

    Yields:
        A callable function. When this function is called, it returns a list
        of all log records captured since the last time it was called, effectively
        acting as a "get new logs" utility.

    A helper class to track and format progress updates for the LiveLog component.

    This versatile class operates in a hybrid mode for calculating iteration rates:

        to compute a smoothed, stable rate. The unit for this internal calculation
        (`it/s` or `s/it`) can be specified during initialization, making it flexible
        for different types of processes.
    2.  **External Override (Preferred):** It can accept a dictionary of externally
        captured rate data (e.g., from a `tqdm` instance). This provides the most
        accurate possible display by sourcing the rate and its unit directly from
        the process being monitored, overriding any internal calculations.

    The tracker also intelligently "freezes" the last known rate when the process
    status changes to 'success' or 'error', ensuring the final speed remains visible on the UI.

        Updates the tracker's state and returns a dictionary formatted for the frontend.

        This is the core method of the tracker. It's designed to be called repeatedly
        during a long-running process. Its key feature is the ability to handle two
        distinct types of updates:

        1.  **Progress Updates (`advance > 0`):** When `advance` is a positive integer,
            the internal progress counter (`self.current`) is incremented. If no external
            `rate_data` is provided, the tracker will perform its internal rate
            calculation based on the time elapsed since the last advancing update.

        2.  **Text-Only Updates (`advance = 0`):** When `advance` is zero, the progress
            bar's position remains unchanged. This is useful for updating contextual
            information on the UI (e.g., "Processing tile 2/10...") without moving the
            main progress bar. In this mode, the method relies exclusively on the
            `rate_data` dictionary to update text fields like `extra_info`. The internal
            rate calculation is skipped, preserving the last known rate.

        Args:
            advance (int): The number of steps to advance the progress counter.
                           Defaults to 1. If 0, no progress is made, but other
                           information (like `extra_info` from `rate_data`) can still be updated.
            status (str): The current status of the process ("running", "success", "error").
            logs (Optional[List[Dict]]): An optional list of log dictionaries to pass to the frontend.
            log_content (Optional[str]): An optional string to override the fixed description for this update.
            rate_data (Optional[Dict]): A dictionary from an external source (like `tqdm`)
                                        containing keys like 'rate', 'unit', and 'extra'.
                                        If provided, this data will override all internal
                                        rate calculations and text fields.
