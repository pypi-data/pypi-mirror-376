# 🚀 Bench AI

**Accelerating engineering workflows at the speed of thought**

## 🎯 What is Bench AI?

Ever wished your CAD software could go **BRRRRR**? Tired of waiting days for design iterations when you could be done in minutes? Welcome to Bench AI - where we turn engineering workflows from slow-motion marathons into Formula 1 races!

This is a placeholder package for the **REAL** Bench AI platform that's revolutionizing how engineering teams work. We're building AI agents that integrate with your existing CAD, CAE, and PLM tools to automate workflows and accelerate product development by 1000x (yes, really!).

## 🎮 Try the Demo

While our main platform is cooking up some serious engineering magic, enjoy this fun CLI that gives you a taste of what we're about:

```bash
pip install bench-ai
```

### Quick Start

```python
from bench_ai import WorkflowAccelerator, DesignSpaceExplorer

# Accelerate your workflows
accelerator = WorkflowAccelerator()
result = accelerator.optimize("thermal_analysis_simulation")
# Watch as days turn into minutes!

# Explore design possibilities across parallel universes
explorer = DesignSpaceExplorer()
explorer.explore(num_scenarios=1000)
# Because why test one design when you can test ALL designs?
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Get motivated
bench-ai hello

# Run our (totally scientific) benchmark
bench-ai benchmark

# Optimize a workflow
bench-ai optimize --workflow "cfd_simulation"

# Explore the multiverse of design
bench-ai explore --scenarios 42
```

## 🤖 The Real Deal

This package is just a fun placeholder! The actual Bench AI platform is where the magic happens:

- **AI Agents** that work across your entire engineering toolstack
- **Parallel Scenario Exploration** - test thousands of designs simultaneously
- **Automatic CAD Revisions** - because manual updating is so last decade
- **Performance Optimization** - turn days of iteration into minutes

## 🏗️ What We're Building

At [Bench AI](https://getbench.ai), we're creating the future of engineering automation:

- Deploy AI agents that understand your engineering workflows
- Integrate seamlessly with existing CAD, CAE, and PLM tools
- Scale your engineering impact without growing headcount
- Ship products faster than ever before

## 🚦 Status

This PyPI package: **Placeholder** (but a fun one!)  
The real platform: **In development** and accepting early access signups!
