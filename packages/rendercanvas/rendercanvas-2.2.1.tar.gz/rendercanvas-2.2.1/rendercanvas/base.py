    Arguments:
        size (tuple): the logical size (width, height) of the canvas.
        title (str): The title of the canvas. Can use '$backend' to show the RenderCanvas class name,

        update_mode (UpdateMode): The mode for scheduling draws and events. Default 'ondemand'.
        min_fps (float): A minimal frames-per-second to use when the ``update_mode`` is 'ondemand'. The default is 0:
        max_fps (float): A maximal frames-per-second to use when the ``update_mode`` is 'ondemand'
            or 'continuous'. The default is 30, which is usually enough.
        vsync (bool): Whether to sync the draw with the monitor update. Helps
            against screen tearing, but can reduce fps. Default True.
        present_method (str | None): Override the method to present the rendered result.
            Can be set to e.g. 'screen' or 'bitmap'. Default None (auto-select).

        This method is only called once, when the context is created.

        Each supported method is represented by a field in the dict. The value
        is another dict with information specific to that present method.
        A canvas backend must implement at least either "screen" or "bitmap".

        With method "screen", the context will render directly to a surface
        representing the region on the screen. The sub-dict should have a ``window``
        field containing the window id. On Linux there should also be ``platform``
        field to distinguish between "wayland" and "x11", and a ``display`` field
        for the display id. This information is used by wgpu to obtain the required
        surface id.

        With method "bitmap", the context will present the result as an image
        bitmap. On GPU-based contexts, the result will first be rendered to an
        offscreen texture, and then downloaded to RAM. The sub-dict must have a
        field 'formats': a list of supported image formats. Examples are "rgba-u8"
