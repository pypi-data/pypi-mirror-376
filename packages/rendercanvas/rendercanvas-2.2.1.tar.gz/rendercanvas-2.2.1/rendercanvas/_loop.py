class BaseLoop:
    """The base class for an event-loop object.

    Canvas backends can implement their own loop subclass (like qt and wx do), but a
    canvas backend can also rely on one of muliple loop implementations (like glfw
    running on asyncio or trio).

    The lifecycle states of a loop are:

    * off (0): the initial state, the subclass should probably not even import dependencies yet.
    * ready (1): the first canvas is created, ``_rc_init()`` is called to get the loop ready for running.
    * active (2): the loop is active, but not running via our entrypoints.
    * active (3): the loop is inter-active in e.g. an IDE.
    * running (4): the loop is running via ``_rc_run()`` or ``_rc_run_async()``.

    Notes:

    * The loop goes back to the "off" state after all canvases are closed.
    * Stopping the loop (via ``.stop()``) closes the canvases, which will then stop the loop.
    * From there it can go back to the ready state (which would call ``_rc_init()`` again).
    * In backends like Qt, the native loop can be started without us knowing: state "active".
    * In interactive settings like an IDE that runs an syncio or Qt loop, the
      loop can become "active" as soon as the first canvas is created.
