"""
Implements a pure Python raw event-loop for backends that don't have an event-loop by themselves, like glfw.

There is not really an advantage over say the asyncio loop, except perhaps that it does not use
asyncio, so you can start an asyncio loop from a callback. Other than that, this is more
for educational purposes: look how simple a loop can be!
