"""
Async-safe nested key-value store with a flat per-route lock map.

This module keeps application data (`db`) as nested dictionaries while
per-route locks are stored in a *flat* map keyed by the route object.
A meta-lock (`locks_guard`) serializes on-demand lock creation to prevent
races where concurrent tasks might create two different locks for the same
route.

Typical usage:
    store = Store(file="/path/to/state.json", file_format="JSON")
    await store.set(Route("users", "42", "name"), "Alice")
    name = await store.get(Route("users", "42", "name"))
    await store.delete(Route("users", "42"))      # collapses parent to None
    await store.drop(Route("users"))              # prunes empty ancestors
    await store.save()                            # async + atomic persistence

Persistence:
    Use `await store.save()` to persist `db` to disk. Saving is performed
    asynchronously using `aiofiles` and is atomic (temp → replace). The file
    file_format is either "JSON" or "YAML" (see `FORMATS`).

    Task-safe nested store for asyncio workloads using a flat per-route lock map.

    Data:
        - `self.db`: nested dictionaries storing arbitrary values.
        - `self.locks`: flat map of per-route asyncio locks.
        - `self.locks_guard`: meta-lock that serializes lock creation so that
          concurrent tasks do not create duplicate locks for the same route.

    Notes:
        - `get()` returns `None` when the path is missing.
        - `set()` auto-creates intermediate dictionaries along the path.
        - `delete()` removes a subtree and, if the *immediate* parent becomes
          empty, replaces that parent with `None` (no recursive prune).
        - `drop()` removes the key and *recursively* prunes empty ancestors.
        - Locks are created lazily upon first use of a route.
