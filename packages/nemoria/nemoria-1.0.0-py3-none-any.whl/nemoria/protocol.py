"""
Core protocol types for Nemoria.

This module defines:
- `Action`: the set of request/response verbs exchanged over the wire
- `Frame`: a single protocol message (request or response) with optional
           correlation (`reply_to`)
- `Connection`: lightweight metadata for a connected peer (id/host/port),
                plus its bound asyncio streams (reader/writer)

class Frame:

    Protocol frame exchanged between client and server.

    A frame encapsulates a single request or response. Correlation between a
    response and the originating request is achieved via the `reply_to` field,
    which may itself contain a serialized `Frame` (typically only its `id`
    matters to correlate).

    Fields:
        id:       Unique identifier (auto-generated by default).
        action:   The verb for this frame (None for pure ACKs if desired).
        route:    Optional path for operations that act on a key/namespace.
        value:    Optional payload (must be JSON-serializable by your transport).
        reply_to: Optional original request frame for correlation.

        Notes:
            - `action` is serialized as its string name (e.g., "GET").
            - `route` is serialized via `Route.encode()`.
            - `reply_to` is serialized **recursively**. In practice, sending a
              minimal reply stub (only `id`, `action`) is sufficient, but this
              method preserves the full structure.
