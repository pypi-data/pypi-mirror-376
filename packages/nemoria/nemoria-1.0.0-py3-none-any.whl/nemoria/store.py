"""
An async-safe nested key-value store with per-route locks (flat lock map).

This module keeps the data (`db`) as nested dicts, while per-route locks are
stored in a flat dict keyed by the route. A meta-lock (`locks_guard`) serializes
lock creation so concurrent tasks don't create two different locks for the same route.

Typical usage:
    store = Store()
    await store.set(Route("users", "42", "name"), "Alice")
    name = await store.get(Route("users", "42", "name"))
    await store.delete(Route("users", "42"))      # collapses parent to None
    await store.drop(Route("users"))              # prunes empty ancestors

    """
    Task-safe nested store for asyncio workloads with a flat lock map.

    Data is held under `self.db` as a nested dict. Per-route locks are kept in
    a flat map `self.locks` keyed by the route (or a stable key for it).
    To avoid races during on-demand lock creation, `locks_guard` protects the
    check-then-create sequence.

    Notes:
        - `get()` returns `None` if the route is missing.
        - `set()` auto-creates intermediate dicts along the route.
        - `delete()` removes the target subtree and collapses its parent to `None` if empty.
        - `drop()` removes the target key and prunes empty parents bottom-up.
        - Locks are created lazily on first use of a route.
