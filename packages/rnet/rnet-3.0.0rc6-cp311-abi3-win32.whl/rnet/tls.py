"""
TLS Utilities and Types

This module provides types and utilities for configuring TLS (Transport Layer Security) in HTTP clients.

These types are typically used to configure client-side TLS authentication and certificate verification in HTTP requests.

        """
        Parses a DER-formatted PKCS #12 archive, using the specified password to decrypt the key.

        The archive should contain a leaf certificate and its private key, as well any intermediate
        certificates that allow clients to build a chain to a trusted root.
        The chain certificates should be in order from the leaf certificate towards the root.

        PKCS #12 archives typically have the file extension `.p12` or `.pfx`, and can be created
        with the OpenSSL `pkcs12` tool:

            openssl pkcs12 -export -out identity.pfx -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem -certfile chain_certs.pem

        Parses a chain of PEM encoded X509 certificates, with the leaf certificate first.
        `key` is a PEM encoded PKCS #8 formatted private key for the leaf certificate.

        The certificate chain should contain any intermediate certificates that should be sent to
        clients to allow them to build a chain to a trusted root.

        A certificate chain here means a series of PEM encoded certificates concatenated together.

class KeyLog:
    """
    Specifies the intent for a (TLS) keylogger to be used in a client or server configuration.

    This type allows you to control how TLS session keys are logged for debugging or analysis.
    You can either use the default environment variable (SSLKEYLOGFILE) or specify a file path
    directly. This is useful for tools like Wireshark that can decrypt TLS traffic if provided
    with the correct session keys.

    Static Methods:
        environment() -> KeyLog
            Use the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable for key logging.
        file(path: Path) -> KeyLog
            Log keys to the specified file path.

    Methods:
        is_environment() -> bool
            Returns True if this policy uses the environment variable.
        is_file() -> bool
            Returns True if this policy logs to a specific file.
