Any new code contributed to :py:mod:`blobmodel` requires testing before it can be merged. All tests are located in the subdirectory `tests/`. 
After you added your tests to this directory you can run

.. code-block:: bash
  
   pytest

to check whether all tests pass. 

In order to check whether all your new code is covered by tests, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest --cov
   coverage html

You can now open `htmlcov/index.html` with your browser to check whether all of your lines are covered by tests.

As a last point, we recommend adding type hints to your new functions and classes, which ensures that youâ€™re using variables and functions in your code correctly. 
We use `mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for this purpose. Check your code by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   mypy  --ignore-missing-imports .
