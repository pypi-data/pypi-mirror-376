# 如何将项目发布到PyPI (2025-09-13 07:01Z)

_**User (2025-09-13 03:27Z)**_

我要如何把目前project變成可以在PyPI上下載到的package呢？

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to turn their current project into a package that can be downloaded from PyPI. This is a question about packaging a Python project for distribution on PyPI (Python Package Index).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! The user already has a well-configured `pyproject.toml` file. Let me also check the README to see if there's any documentation about installation or usage.</details></think>

No results found
</details>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I notice there's no LICENSE file. Let me check if there's one in the .gitignore or if it's mentioned in the classifiers. Also, let me check the current pyproject.toml more carefully - I see they have "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License" but no actual LICENSE file.


## Examining Project Licensing

- Found no LICENSE file in the project, which is unusual for open-source projects.
- Noticed "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License" in pyproject.</details></think>

## 📋 總結

你的 Quote0 專案現在已經準備好發佈到 PyPI 了！

### ✅ 已完成的準備工作：
- ✅ 添加了 MIT 授權文件
- ✅ 更新了 `pyproject.toml` 配置
- ✅ 安裝了建置工具
- ✅ 成功建置了發行包
- ✅ 本地測試通過

### 🚀 下一步：

1. **創建 PyPI 帳號**：
   - 前往 [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) 註冊帳號
   - 前往 [Account Settings > API tokens](https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens) 創建 API token
   - 儲存 token（格式類似：`pypi-xxx...`）

2. **設定 twine 認證**：
   ```bash
   # 創建 ~/.pypirc 文件
   cat > ~/.pypirc << EOF
   [pypi]
   username = __token__
   password = 你的_API_token_這裡

   [testpypi]
   username = __token__
   password = 你的_API_token_這裡
   EOF
   ```

3. **上傳到 PyPI**：
   ```bash
   # 先測試上傳到 TestPyPI（推薦）
   uv run twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

   # 確認測試環境正常後，上傳到正式 PyPI
   uv run twine upload dist/*
   ```

### 📦 使用你的套件

發佈成功後，其他人就可以這樣安裝：
```bash
pip install quote0
# 或者
uv add quote0
```

然後在程式中使用：
```python
from quote0 import Quote0

client = Quote0()
# ... 使用 API
```

你的專案結構很棒，使用現代的 `pyproject.toml`、src layout，以及完整的 CLI 支援。現在只需要完成 PyPI 帳號設定和上傳就可以了！

有任何問題嗎？

_**User (2025-09-13 03:27Z)**_

目前已經成功上傳！

為了使更多人可以使用 其實我們的project並沒有嚴格限制 python version >=3.13
根據我們目前的語法 降低這個限制

  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (>=3.8) does not satisfy Python>=3.9 and all of:

       cannot be used.

      and matplotlib==3.9.1 was yanked (reason: The Windows wheels, under some conditions, caused
      segfaults in unrelated user code.  Due to this we deleted the Windows wheels to prevent these
      segfaults, however this caused greater disruption as pip then began to try (and fail) to build
      3.9.1 from the sdist on Windows which impacted far more users.  Yanking the whole release is
      the only tool available to eliminate these failures without changes to on the user side.  The
      sdist, OSX wheel, and manylinux wheels are all functional and there are no critical bugs in
      the release.   Downstream packagers should not yank their builds of Matplotlib 3.9.1.  See
      https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/28551 for details), we can conclude that
      matplotlib>=3.8.0,<3.10.0 cannot be used. (1)

      Because the requested Python version (>=3.8) does not satisfy Python>=3.10 and matplotlib>=3.10.0
      depends on Python>=3.10, we can conclude that matplotlib>=3.10.0 cannot be used.
      And because we know from (1) that matplotlib>=3.8.0,<3.10.0 cannot be used, we can conclude that
      matplotlib>=3.8.0 cannot be used.
      And because your project depends on matplotlib>=3.8.0, we can conclude that your project's
      requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: Pre-releases are available for `matplotlib` in the requested range (e.g., 3.10.0rc1), but
      pre-releases weren't enabled (try: `--prerelease=allow`)

      hint: The `requires-python` value (>=3.8) includes Python versions that are not supported by your
      dependencies (e.g., all of:
          matplotlib>=3.8.0,<=3.9.0
          matplotlib>=3.9.1.post1,<=3.9.4
       only supports >=3.9). Consider using a more restrictive `requires-python` value (like >=3.9).
