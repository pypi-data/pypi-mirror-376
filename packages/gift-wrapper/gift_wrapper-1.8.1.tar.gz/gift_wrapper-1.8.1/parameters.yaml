images hosting:

  ssh:
    user: mvazquez

    # below, one should specify either a password for the user or  "public key" file but NOT both of them

    password:

    # "~" stands for the user's home directory (in Linux for one...)
    public_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa_mymachine.pub

  copy:
    # machine into which files will be copied
    host: hidra1

    # the path that in the remote machine acts as root of the publicly visible directories hierarchy (hence it's not
    # visible from outside);  it *should* exist ("." stands for the working directory when you ssh into the machine)
    public filesystem root: ./public_html

  # public address from which the images will hang
  public URL: http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~mvazquez/
