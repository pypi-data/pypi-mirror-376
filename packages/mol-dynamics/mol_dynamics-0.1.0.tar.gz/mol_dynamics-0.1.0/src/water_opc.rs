//! We use the [OPC model](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jz501780a) for water.
//! See also, the Amber Reference Manual.
//!
//! This is a rigid model that includes an "EP" or "M" massless charge-only molecule (No LJ terms),
//! and no charge on the Oxygen. We integrate it using standard Amber-style forces.
//! Amber strongly recommends using this model when their ff19SB foces for proteins.
//!
//! Amber RM: "OPC is a non-polarizable, 4-point, 3-charge rigid water model. Geometrically, it
//! resembles TIP4P-like mod-
//! els, although the values of OPC point charges and charge-charge distances are quite different.
//! The model has a single VDW center on the oxygen nucleus."
//!
//! Note: The original paper uses the term "M" for the massless charge; Amber calls it "EP".
//!
//! We integrate the molecule's internal rigid geometry using the `SETTLE` algorithm. This is likely
//! to be cheaper, and more robust than Shake/Rattle. It's less general, but it works here.
//! Settle is specifically tailored for three-atom rigid bodies.
//!
//! This module, in particular, contains structs, constants, and the integrator.
