Use your overpowered GPU to run AI that produces creative retro-style games! Enter your prompt and the playable game pops open in minutes.

Push your imagination to the limit, it's 100% free and local.


## Hardware Requirement

Lemonade Arcade uses a 30 billion parameter LLM to generate games, which requires certain hardware specs to run well.

| Configuration | GPU/APU | Memory | Disk Space |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Minimum (CPU)** | Ryzen AI 7000-series chip or newer | 32 GB RAM | 20 GB |
| **Suggested (dGPU)** | Radeon 7800XT or newer | 16 GB VRAM | 20 GB |
| **Suggested (APU)** | Strix Halo (Ryzen AI MAX 395) | 64 GB unified memory | 20 GB |

## Demo

> [!TIP]
> Generate creative new retro-style games in minutes, based on prompts like `Make space invaders, but I can fly around the whole screen instead of being stuck on the bottom.`

> [!TIP]
> Right click any game you've generated to get the Python source code or the prompt, so you can edit and remix further!

## Overview

Lemonade Arcade combines the convenience of a ChatGPT-like interface with the concept of a game emulator. Instead of emulating existing games, it uses LLMs (served by [Lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade)) to generate completely new games based on your prompts, then lets you play them instantly.

## Features

- **Lemonade integration**: automatically connects to Lemonade Server and has access to any Lemonade LLM.
- **AI Game Generation**: Describe a game concept and watch as an LLM creates a playable Python game.
- **Game Library**: All generated games are saved and can be replayed anytime.
- **Easy Management**: View game source code, copy prompts for remixing, and delete games you don't want with a simple click.

## Installation

### Windows

Navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade-arcade/releases), download the .exe, and get started!

### Linux (and Windows Devs)

From PyPI (recommended):

```bash
pip install lemonade-arcade
lemonade-arcade
```

From Source:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade-arcade
   cd lemonade-arcade
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Run it:
   ```bash
   lemonade-arcade
   ```

## Architecture

### Game Generation

Games are generated with the following constraints:
- Pure Python using the pygame library only.
- No external images, sounds, or asset files.
- Complete and playable with proper game mechanics.
- Proper event handling and game loops.
- Visual appeal using pygame's built-in drawing functions.

> Note: LLMs are imperfect, and may fail to generate the game you asked for or fail to generate a functioning game at all.

### Game Cache

Games are cached under the `.lemonade-arcade` folder in your home directory.

```
~/.lemonade-arcade/
└── games/
    ├── metadata.json    # Game titles and descriptions
    ├── abc12345.py      # Generated game files
    └── xyz67890.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Server Offline" Status
- Ensure Lemonade Server is running on `http://localhost:8000`.
- Check that you have models installed in Lemonade Server by opening the model manager: http://localhost:8000/#model-management.
- Visit [lemonade-server.ai](https://lemonade-server.ai) for setup instructions.

### Game Won't Launch
- Check the generated code for any syntax errors.
- Try regenerating the game with a more specific prompt.

### Generation Failures
- Try a simpler game concept.
- Make sure your selected model supports code generation.
- Check the `lemonade-arcade` and Lemonade Server logs for errors.

## Examples

Here are some example prompts that work well:

- **Classic Games**: "pong", "tetris", "pacman maze game", "asteroids"
- **Variations**: "snake but food teleports", "breakout with power-ups", "flappy bird in space"
- **Original Ideas**: "catching falling stars", "color matching puzzle", "maze with moving walls"
