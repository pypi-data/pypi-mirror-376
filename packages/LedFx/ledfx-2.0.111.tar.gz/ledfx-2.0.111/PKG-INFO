#. **Build your networked LED Strip.**
      - For most, this is the difficult step. Don't worry! There's guides here and online, and plenty of people able to help on WLED and LedFx Discord.
      - Follow the `WLED guide to connect the LED strip and ESP together <https://kno.wled.ge/basics/getting-started/>`_.
      - `Flash WLED to the ESP device <https://kno.wled.ge/basics/install-binary/>`_.
      - Ensure all WLED devices are powered on, and connected to your Wi-Fi.
      - Test you can access the WLED web interface from your PC. If so, then you're good to go!

#. **Install LedFx.**
      - For PC and Mac, see our `releases`_, or see the `installation documentation`_ for more information.
      - For linux, you can use pip to install ledfx - however you may need to install some dependencies first. See the `installation documentation`_ for more information.

#. **Direct computer audio output to LedFx.**
      - By default on Windows LedFx will attempt to listen to your system audio.
      - More information for `Linux and macOS users here <https://ledfx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directing_audio.html>`_.
      - Play some music in the background.

#. **Start LedFx.**
      - Your WLED devices should appear in LedFx, automagically configured and ready to go! üéÜüî•
      - If not, on the bottom click Home,  -> ``Scan for WLED devices`` button, or click on the big plus sign and ``Add Device`` to add them manually.
      - If they're still not showing up, make sure they're powered on and properly connected to your WiFi.

#. **Start using effects!**
      - Click on the device, select an effect eg ``scroll`` under Classic
      - Your lights should now be reacting realtime to your music! Enjoy the show üåà
