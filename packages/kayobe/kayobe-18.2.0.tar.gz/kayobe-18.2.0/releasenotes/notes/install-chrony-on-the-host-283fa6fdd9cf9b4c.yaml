    Updates the NTP implementation from the chrony container deployed by
    kolla-ansible to configuring chrony as a host service.  Chrony is now
    installed on all hosts in the ``ntp`` group, which defaults to include
    the seed, overcloud, and seed-hypervisor groups. On existing deployments,
    you should run `kayobe overcloud host configure` to migrate from the
    kolla-ansible deployed container. This can optionally be scoped to just
    use the ``ntp`` tag. You can continue to use the kolla container by
    setting `kolla_enable_chrony` to ``true``.
