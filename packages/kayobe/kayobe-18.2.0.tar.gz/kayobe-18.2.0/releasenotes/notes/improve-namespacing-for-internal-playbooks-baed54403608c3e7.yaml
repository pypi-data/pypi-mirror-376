fixes:
  - |
    The Ansible search paths, when running Kayobe internal playbooks, have been
    modified so that collections, roles and plugins internal to the Kayobe
    installation have precedence over those installed in Kayobe configuration.
    This improves the usability as it is now possible to install a newer
    version of an extension without affecting internal Kayobe playbooks.

upgrade:
  - |
    Ansible plugins, roles, and collections (collectively known as extensions)
    installed in Kayobe configuration no longer have precedence over internal
    Kayobe variants of the same extension. You can revert back to the previous
    behaviour by manually exporting the relevant Ansible variables, e.g
    ``ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH``. It is not anticipated that this will affect
    many users as it is still possible to supplement Kayobe with additional
    plugins.
  - |
    System folders and home directories are no longer searched when looking for
    Ansible extensions. It is recommended to install your collections using
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/ansible/requirements.yml``.
