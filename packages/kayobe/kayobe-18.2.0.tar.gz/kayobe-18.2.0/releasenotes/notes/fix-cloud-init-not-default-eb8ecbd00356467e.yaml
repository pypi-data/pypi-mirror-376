    Fixes an issue where networking failed to come up after kayobe
    ``overcloud host provision`` as cloud-init wasn't installed. Add
    ``cloud-init`` element to ``overcloud_dib_elements_default`` so it's no
    longer missing.
    Expected behavior was that ``cloud-init-datasource`` had it as dependency.
