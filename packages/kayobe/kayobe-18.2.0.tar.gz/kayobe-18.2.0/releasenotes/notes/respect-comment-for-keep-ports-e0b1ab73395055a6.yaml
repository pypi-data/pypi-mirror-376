    If you have customized ``inspector_keep_ports``, ensure it is set to one
    of: ``all``, ``present``, or ``added``. Prior to this release, setting
    ``inspector_keep_ports`` to any truthy value would result in the
    ``keep_ports`` Ironic Inspector configuration option being set to
    ``present``. As the default value of ``inspector_keep_ports`` is ``added``,
    we are effectively changing the default value of ``keep_ports`` from
    ``present`` to ``added``. If you are relying on the previous behaviour
    you should set ``ironic_keep_ports`` to ``present``.

    ``inspector_keep_ports`` can be set to one of: ``all``, ``present``,
    ``added``. The previous behavior was to set this to ``present`` if the
    variable was changed to any truthy value. This respects the behavior
    indicated in the comments.
