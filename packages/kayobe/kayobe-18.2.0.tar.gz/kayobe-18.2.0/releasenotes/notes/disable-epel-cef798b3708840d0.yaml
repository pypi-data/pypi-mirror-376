    The default value of ``dnf_install_epel`` has been changed to ``false``.
    This means that the EPEL DNF repository is no longer installed by default.
    Neither existing EPEL repositories nor the ``epel-release`` package will be
    removed. If necessary, EPEL may be enabled by setting ``dnf_install_epel``
    to ``true`` in ``dnf.yml``. See `story 2009757
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009757>`__ for details.
