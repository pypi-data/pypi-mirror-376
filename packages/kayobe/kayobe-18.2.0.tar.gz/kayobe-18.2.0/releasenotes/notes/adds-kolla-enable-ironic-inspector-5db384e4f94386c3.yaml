    Adds the kolla feature flag: ``kolla_enable_ironic_inspector``. This
    defaults to ``true`` if you have enabled Ironic as Kayobe makes extensive
    use of introspection rules.  Please note that whilst ironic inspector is
    deprecated, some features, such as introspection rules are not currently
    implemented in the replacement implementation built-in to Ironic.  See
    :ironic-doc:`Ironic documentation <admin/inspection/migration.html>` for
    more details.
