    Improves failure handling in the ``kayobe * host configure`` commands by
    avoiding use of the ``kolla-ansible bootstrap-servers`` command, and moving
    all relevant functionality to Kayobe playbooks. This ensures that
    if a host fails during a host configuration command, other hosts are able
    to continue to completion. This is useful at scale, where host failures
    occur more frequently. See `story 2009854
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009854>`__ for details. Refer
    to the upgrade notes for information about the implications of this change.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``kayobe * host configure`` commands no longer use the ``kolla-ansible
    bootstrap-servers`` command, and associated ``baremetal`` role in Kolla
    Ansible. The functionality provided by the ``baremetal`` role has been
    extracted into a new ``openstack.kolla`` Ansible collection, and split into
    separate roles. This allows Kayobe to use it directly, and only the
    necessary parts.

    This change improves failure handling in these Kayobe commands, and aims to
    reduce confusion over which ``--limit`` and ``--tags`` arguments to
    provide.

    This change has implications for configuration of Kayobe, since some
    variables that were previously in Kolla Ansible are now in Kayobe. The
    following is an incomplete list of variables that have changed scoped from
    Kolla Ansible to Kayobe::

    * ``enable_docker_repo``
    * ``docker_apt_url``
    * ``docker_apt_repo``
    * ``docker_apt_key_file``
    * ``docker_apt_key_id``
    * ``docker_apt_package``
    * ``docker_yum_url``
    * ``docker_yum_baseurl``
    * ``docker_yum_gpgkey``
    * ``docker_yum_gpgcheck``
    * ``docker_yum_package``
    * ``customize_etc_hosts``
    * ``docker_storage_driver``
    * ``docker_custom_option``
    * ``docker_custom_config``
    * ``docker_http_proxy``
    * ``docker_https_proxy``
    * ``docker_no_proxy``
    * ``debian_pkg_install``
    * ``redhat_pkg_install``
    * ``ubuntu_pkg_removals``
    * ``redhat_pkg_removals``

    The following Kolla Ansible variables are no longer relevant::

    * ``create_kolla_user``
    * ``create_kolla_user_sudoers``
    * ``kolla_user``
    * ``kolla_group``
    * ``change_selinux``
    * ``selinux_state``
    * ``host_python_version``
    * ``virtualenv``
    * ``virtualenv_site_packages``
