    Adds support for configuring HTTP(S) proxy settings using the
    ``http_proxy``, ``https_proxy`` and ``no_proxy`` variables in
    ``proxy.yml``. These variables are passed down to Kolla Ansible which uses
    them to configure Docker, allowing container image pull operations and
    container networking to use HTTP(S) proxies.
