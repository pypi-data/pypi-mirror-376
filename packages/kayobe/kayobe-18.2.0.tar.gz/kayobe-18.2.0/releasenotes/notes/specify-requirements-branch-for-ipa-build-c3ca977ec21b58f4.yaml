    Deployment image (IPA) build no longer uses master version of
    upper-constraints. Instead, it defaults to using the constraints for the
    OpenStack release associated with the version of Kayobe being used. See
    `story 2009810 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009810>`__ for
    details.
