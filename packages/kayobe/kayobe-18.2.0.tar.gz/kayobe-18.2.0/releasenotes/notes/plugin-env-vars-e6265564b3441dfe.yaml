features:

    Roles, collections and plugins included with Kayobe configuration are now
    accessible to all Kayobe playbook executions.
upgrade:
  - |
    Changes the environment used during Kayobe playbook execution to include
    Kayobe's collections, roles and plugins in the Ansible lookup paths.
    This allows custom playbooks to use these items, without the requirement to
    symlink into the Kayobe installation. Existing symlinks may be removed.
