    In production environments, the provision network may be separated from the
    other networks, so in this case, if you want Bifrost's DHCP service provides
    the correct gateway for the clients the ``inspection_gateway`` should be
    used instead of the ``gateway`` attribute for the provision network. This
    also avoids configuring the multiple IP gateways on a single host which
    leads to unpredictable results.
