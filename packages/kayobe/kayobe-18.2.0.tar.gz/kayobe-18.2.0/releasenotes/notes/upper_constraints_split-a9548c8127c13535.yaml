    Updates the ``stackhpc.os-images`` role to version 0.16.0. This new release
    separates configuration of upper constraints for diskimage-builder (DIB)
    from those used by the OpenStack SDK and client. This allows operators to
    use a newer version of DIB while keeping compatible versions of the
    OpenStack SDK and client. This is configured with the following variables:

    * ``ipa_build_dib_upper_constraints_file`` in ``ipa.yml``
    * ``overcloud_dib_dib_upper_constraints_file`` in ``overcloud-dib.yml``

    The variables are empty by default in order to allow for Rocky Linux 9
    image builds.
