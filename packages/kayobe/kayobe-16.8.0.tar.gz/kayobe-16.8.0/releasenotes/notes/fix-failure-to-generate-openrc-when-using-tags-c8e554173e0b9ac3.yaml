    ``public-openrc.sh`` is now only generated if the ``admin-openrc.sh`` file
    generated by Kolla Ansible exists. This fixes an issue where the task would
    fail, when running in a clean environment, with a set of Kolla Ansible tags
    that did not include the generation of ``admin-openrc.sh``. See `story
    2009323 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009323>`__.
