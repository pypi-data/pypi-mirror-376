    Removes the ``kolla_ironic_default_boot_option`` variable and the
    ``inspector_rule_local_boot`` inspector rule, since Ironic has removed
    support for defining a boot option configuration. The ``Set local boot
    capability`` rule should be removed from Bifrost and Ironic Inspector by
    the operator.
