    Adds functionality to configure desired SELinux state (in addition to
    disabling SELinux previously).
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``disable-selinux`` role has been renamed to ``selinux`` and so have
    been the related variables. If you set one of them, adapt your
    configuration:

    * ``disable_selinux_do_reboot`` becomes ``selinux_do_reboot``
    * ``disable_selinux_reboot_timeout`` becomes ``selinux_reboot_timeout``
  - |
    Kayobe now sets SELinux to ``permissive`` by default (compared to
    ``disabled`` previously). This may require a reboot, which will only be
    triggered if ``selinux_do_reboot`` is set to ``true``. If you want to
    retain previous behaviour, set ``selinux_state`` to ``disabled``.
