    Improves error handling by adding a top-level playbook for the ``kayobe *
    host configure`` and ``kayobe * host upgrade`` commands. This ensures that
    if a host fails during a host configuration command, other hosts are able
    to continue to completion. This is useful at scale, where host failures
    occur more frequently. See `story 2009854
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009854>`__ for details.
