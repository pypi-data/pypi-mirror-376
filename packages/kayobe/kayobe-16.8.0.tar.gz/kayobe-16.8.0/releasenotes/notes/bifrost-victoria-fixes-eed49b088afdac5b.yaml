upgrade:
  - |
    When interacting with Bifrost, sourcing the ``env-vars`` file is not
    supported anymore. Set the ``OS_CLOUD`` environment variable to ``bifrost``
    instead or run ``. ~/openrc bifrost``.
  - |
    When interacting with Bifrost, it is recommended to use the ironic native
    ``baremetal`` command instead of ``openstack baremetal``, as the
    availability of OpenStackClient inside the Bifrost container is not
    guaranteed.
deprecations:
  - |
    When interacting with Bifrost, the use of ``OS_CLOUD=bifrost-inspector`` is
    deprecated and should be replaced by ``OS_CLOUD=bifrost``.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes failure in the ``kayobe seed deployment image build`` command due to
    changes in Bifrost.
