features:
  - |
    Adds a new ``kolla_bifrost_use_firewalld`` variable used to define whether
    Bifrost uses firewalld, which is now disabled by default.
upgrade:
  - |
    Bifrost is now configured to avoid using firewalld, to prevent conflicts
    with firewall rules set by Kayobe on the seed host. The existing behaviour
    can be retained by setting ``kolla_bifrost_use_firewalld`` to ``True`` in
    ``bifrost.yml``.
fixes:
  - |
    Prevents Bifrost from using firewalld to avoid conflicts with firewall
    rules set by Kayobe on the seed host. See `story 2009252
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009252>`__ for more details.
