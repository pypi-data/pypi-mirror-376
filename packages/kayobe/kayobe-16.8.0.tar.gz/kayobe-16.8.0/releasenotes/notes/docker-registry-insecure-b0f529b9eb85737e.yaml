features:
  - |
    Adds a new variable ``kolla_docker_registry_insecure`` to configure whether
    Docker should use an insecure registry for Kolla images.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default configuration of Docker, as set by Kolla Ansible, has changed
    to stop using an insecure registry for Kolla images. To avoid breaking
    existing deployments, ``kolla_docker_registry_insecure`` is automatically
    set to ``true`` if Kayobe is configured to deploy an insecure registry
    service. If using an insecure registry not deployed by Kayobe, you will
    need to set the value of ``kolla_docker_registry_insecure`` to ``true`` or
    configure TLS for your registry.
