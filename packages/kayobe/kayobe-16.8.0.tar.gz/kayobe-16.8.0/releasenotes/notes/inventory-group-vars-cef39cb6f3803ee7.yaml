    Changes the Kayobe playbook group variables in ``ansible/group_vars/`` to
    be inventory group variables in ``ansible/inventory/group_vars``. This has
    two important consequences:

    1. Inventory group variables have a lower precedence than playbook group
       variables. This means that these variables can now be overridden by
       group variables in the Kayobe configuration inventory.

    2. The new inventory group variables are automatically used by all Kayobe
       commands, and do not need to be in the same directory as the playbook
       being executed. This means that the `previous workaround
       <https://docs.openstack.org/kayobe/yoga/custom-ansible-playbooks.html#packaging-custom-playbooks-with-configuration>`_
       for custom playbooks involving symlinking to the ``group_vars``
       directory from the directory containing the custom playbook is no longer
       necessary.
