upgrade:
  - |
    Updates the maximum supported version of Ansible from 2.9 to 4.x
    (ansible-core 2.11). The minimum supported version is updated from 2.9 to
    2.10. This is true for both Kayobe and Kolla Ansible.
  - |
    Upgrading directly from Ansible 2.9 to Ansible 2.10 or from Ansible 2.10 to
    Ansible 4 is known to cause problems. You should uninstall Ansible before
    upgrading your Kayobe virtual environment:

    .. code-block:: console

       pip uninstall ansible

    If upgrading from Ansible 2.10 to a newer version, also uninstall
    ``ansible-base``:

    .. code-block:: console

       pip uninstall ansible-base
