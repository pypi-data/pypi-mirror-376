    Ironic Inspector configuration can now be customised by placing config
    overrides in the ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/kolla/config/ironic-inspector`` or
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/environments/<environment>/kolla/config/ironic-inspector``
    directories. This can be used to a define a ``known_devices.yaml`` file
    which is used to configure the ``accelerators`` plugin in Ironic Inspector.
