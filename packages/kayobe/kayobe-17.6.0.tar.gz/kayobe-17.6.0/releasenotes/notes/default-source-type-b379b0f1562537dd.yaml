upgrade:
  - |
    Updates the default image type to ``source``. Users wishing to build and
    deploy ``binary`` type images should set ``kolla_install_type`` to
    ``binary`` in ``kolla.yml``. This change is to reflect the reality that
    source images are tested more thoroughly and we (as OpenStack community)
    have better control over them.
issues:
  - |
    Switching an existing deployment from ``binary`` to ``source`` images can
    break Horizon, which can be resolved by flushing contents of ``memcached``
    with ``docker restart memcached``. See `Kolla Ansible bug 1886549
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1886549>`__ for details.
