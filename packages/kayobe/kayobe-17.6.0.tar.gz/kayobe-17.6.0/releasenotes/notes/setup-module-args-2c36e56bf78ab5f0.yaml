features:
  - |
    Adds support for configuring the ``filter`` and ``gather_subset`` arguments
    for the ``setup`` module via ``kayobe_ansible_setup_filter`` and
    ``kayobe_ansible_setup_gather_subset`` respectively. These can be used to
    reduce the number of facts, which can have a significant effect on
    performance of Ansible.
  - |
    Adds a new command, ``kayobe overcloud facts gather``, to gather Ansible
    facts for overcloud hosts. This may be useful for populating a fact cache.
