    Fixes an issue with config drive generation for infrastructure and seed VMs
    when using untagged interfaces. The symptom of this issue is that kayobe
    cannot login to the instance. If you check the libvirt console log, you
    will see ``KeyError: 'vlan_link'``. See `story 2009910
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2009910>`__ for details.
