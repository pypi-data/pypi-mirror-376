upgrade:
  - |
    Updates the maximum supported version of Ansible from 4.x (ansible-core
    2.11) to 5.x (ansible-core 2.12). The minimum supported version is updated
    from 2.10 to 4.x. This is true for both Kayobe and Kolla Ansible. Note that
    environments with Python 3.7 or lower (e.g. CentOS Stream 8) will be
    limited to Ansible 4.x (ansible-core 2.11).
  - |
    Upgrading directly from Ansible 2.10 to Ansible 4 or later is known to
    cause problems. You should uninstall ``ansible`` and ``ansible-base``
    before upgrading your Kayobe virtual environment:

    .. code-block:: console

       pip uninstall ansible ansible-base
