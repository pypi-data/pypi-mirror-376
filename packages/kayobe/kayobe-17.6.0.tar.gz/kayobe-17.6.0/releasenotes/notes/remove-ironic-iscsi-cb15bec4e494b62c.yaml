upgrade:
  - |
    Removes the ``iscsi`` interface from
    ``kolla_ironic_enabled_deploy_interfaces``, and changes
    ``kolla_ironic_default_deploy_interface`` to ``direct``. This is in line
    with upstream changes in Ironic during the Xena cycle, in which the
    ``iscsi`` deploy driver was removed.

    Existing nodes using the ``iscsi`` deploy driver should be updated to an
    alternative such as ``direct`` before upgrading.
