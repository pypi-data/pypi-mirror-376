    When to use:
        The `OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker` is designed to interact with endpoints that are compatible with OpenAI\'s chat
        completion API contract. This includes but are not limited to:
        1. DeepInfra (https://deepinfra.com/)
        2. DeepSeek (https://deepseek.com/)
        3. Groq (https://groq.com/)
        4. OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai/)
        5. Text Generation Inference (https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)
        6. Together.ai (https://together.ai/)
        7. vLLM (https://vllm.ai/)
        When using this invoker, please note that the supported features and capabilities may vary between different
        endpoints and language models. Using features that are not supported by the endpoint will result in an error.

    Basic usage:
        The `OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker` can be used as follows:
        ```python
        lm_invoker = OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker(
            model_name="llama3-8b-8192",
            base_url="https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
            api_key="<your-api-key>"
        )
        result = await lm_invoker.invoke("Hi there!")
        ```

    Input types:
        The `OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker` supports the following input types: text, audio, document, and image.
        Non-text inputs can be passed as an `Attachment` object with the `user` role.

        Usage example:
        ```python
        text = "What animal is in this image?"
        image = Attachment.from_path("path/to/local/image.png")
        result = await lm_invoker.invoke([text, image])
        ```

    Tool calling:
        Tool calling is a feature that allows the language model to call tools to perform tasks.
        Tools can be passed to the via the `tools` parameter as a list of `Tool` objects.
        When tools are provided and the model decides to call a tool, the tool calls are stored in the
        `tool_calls` attribute in the output.

        Usage example:
        ```python
        lm_invoker = OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker(..., tools=[tool_1, tool_2])
        ```

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Let me call the tools...",
            tool_calls=[
                ToolCall(id="123", name="tool_1", args={"key": "value"}),
                ToolCall(id="456", name="tool_2", args={"key": "value"}),
            ]
        )
        ```

    Structured output:
        Structured output is a feature that allows the language model to output a structured response.
        This feature can be enabled by providing a schema to the `response_schema` parameter.

        The schema must be either a JSON schema dictionary or a Pydantic BaseModel class.
        If JSON schema is used, it must be compatible with Pydantic\'s JSON schema, especially for complex schemas.
        For this reason, it is recommended to create the JSON schema using Pydantic\'s `model_json_schema` method.

        The language model also doesn\'t need to stream anything when structured output is enabled. Thus, standard
        invocation will be performed regardless of whether the `event_emitter` parameter is provided or not.

        When enabled, the structured output is stored in the `structured_output` attribute in the output.
        1. If the schema is a JSON schema dictionary, the structured output is a dictionary.
        2. If the schema is a Pydantic BaseModel class, the structured output is a Pydantic model.

        # Example 1: Using a JSON schema dictionary
        Usage example:
        ```python
        schema = {
            "title": "Animal",
            "description": "A description of an animal.",
            "properties": {
                "color": {"title": "Color", "type": "string"},
                "name": {"title": "Name", "type": "string"},
            },
            "required": ["name", "color"],
            "type": "object",
        }
        lm_invoker = OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker(..., response_schema=schema)
        ```
        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(structured_output={"name": "Golden retriever", "color": "Golden"})
        ```

        # Example 2: Using a Pydantic BaseModel class
        Usage example:
        ```python
        class Animal(BaseModel):
            name: str
            color: str

        lm_invoker = OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker(..., response_schema=Animal)
        ```
        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(structured_output=Animal(name="Golden retriever", color="Golden"))
        ```

    Analytics tracking:
        Analytics tracking is a feature that allows the module to output additional information about the invocation.
        This feature can be enabled by setting the `output_analytics` parameter to `True`.
        When enabled, the following attributes will be stored in the output:
        1. `token_usage`: The token usage.
        2. `duration`: The duration in seconds.
        3. `finish_details`: The details about how the generation finished.

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Golden retriever is a good dog breed.",
            token_usage=TokenUsage(input_tokens=100, output_tokens=50),
            duration=0.729,
            finish_details={"finish_reason": "stop"},
        )
        ```

        When streaming is enabled, token usage is not supported. Therefore, the `token_usage` attribute will be `None`
        regardless of the value of the `output_analytics` parameter.

    Retry and timeout:
        The `OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker` supports retry and timeout configuration.
        By default, the max retries is set to 0 and the timeout is set to 30.0 seconds.
        They can be customized by providing a custom `RetryConfig` object to the `retry_config` parameter.

        Retry config examples:
        ```python
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=0, timeout=0.0)  # No retry, no timeout
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=0, timeout=10.0)  # No retry, 10.0 seconds timeout
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=5, timeout=0.0)  # 5 max retries, no timeout
        retry_config = RetryConfig(max_retries=5, timeout=10.0)  # 5 max retries, 10.0 seconds timeout
        ```

        Usage example:
        ```python
        lm_invoker = OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker(..., retry_config=retry_config)
        ```

    Reasoning:
        Some language models support advanced reasoning capabilities. When using such reasoning-capable models,
        you can configure how much reasoning the model should perform before generating a final response by setting
        reasoning-related parameters.

        The reasoning effort of reasoning models can be set via the `reasoning_effort` parameter. This parameter
        will guide the models on how many reasoning tokens it should generate before creating a response to the prompt.
        The reasoning effort is only supported by some language models.
        Available options include:
        1. "low": Favors speed and economical token usage.
        2. "medium": Favors a balance between speed and reasoning accuracy.
        3. "high": Favors more complete reasoning at the cost of more tokens generated and slower responses.
        This may differ between models. When not set, the reasoning effort will be equivalent to None by default.

        When using reasoning models, some providers might output the reasoning summary. These will be stored in the
        `reasoning` attribute in the output.

        Output example:
        ```python
        LMOutput(
            response="Golden retriever is a good dog breed.",
            reasoning=[Reasoning(id="", reasoning="Let me think about it...")],
        )
        ```

        When streaming is enabled along with reasoning and the provider supports reasoning output, the reasoning token
        will be streamed with the `EventType.DATA` event type.

        Streaming output example:
        ```python
        {"type": "data", "value": \'{"data_type": "thinking_start", "data_value": ""}\', ...}
        {"type": "data", "value": \'{"data_type": "thinking", "data_value": "Let me think "}\', ...}
        {"type": "data", "value": \'{"data_type": "thinking", "data_value": "about it..."}\', ...}
        {"type": "data", "value": \'{"data_type": "thinking_end", "data_value": ""}\', ...}
        {"type": "response", "value": "Golden retriever ", ...}
        {"type": "response", "value": "is a good dog breed.", ...}

        Setting reasoning-related parameters for non-reasoning models will raise an error.

        The output of the `OpenAICompatibleLMInvoker` can either be:
        1. `str`: The text response if no additional output is needed.
