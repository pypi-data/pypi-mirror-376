# AveyTense

**AveyTense** is a library written by Aveyzan using Python, which provides especially extensions to inbuilt Python solutions.

## Features

Features are included in [this page](https://aveyzan.xyz/aveytense).
For code changes see [this Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GC_KAOXML65jNfBZA8GhVViqPnrMoFtbLv_jHvUhBlg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Getting started

To install AveyTense, run the following command:

```
pip install aveytense
```

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above (before 0.3.46 - 3.9 or above). The command will also install [`typing_extensions`](https://pypi.org/project/typing_extensions).

If you think you are out of date, consider checking out [releases section](https://pypi.org/project/aveytense/#history) and running following command:

```py
pip install --upgrade aveytense
```

After installation process, you can import module `aveytense`, which imports AveyTense components into your project.

> **Note**: It is highly recommended to install latest final version of AveyTense. Do not rely on alpha, beta releases, and
> release candidates before their final counterparts are published.

> **Warning**: Some definitions will be still prone for errors due to the backward-compatibility. For code changes to completely
> support Python versions before Python 3.12 there will be still need to inspect every definition included in the project.

## Support

If you found anomalies in code or/and want to suggest changes, consider sending mail to [my email](mailto:aveyzan@gmail.com) or
creating an issue in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Aveyzan/AveyTense/issues). Bug fixes will be issued in future versions
of AveyTense. The project isn't intended to be a malware.
