## The Vision: Your Code Contributions as Verifiable Assets

In today's digital economy, developers build their careers through contributions to open source projects, but this professional reputation is **trapped within platforms** and **impossible to verify** across contexts. What if your GitHub contributions, code reviews, and technical expertise could become **portable, verifiable assets** that follow you throughout your career?

**Cyberstorm Schemas** provide the foundational data structures for building this future‚Äîwhere every meaningful contribution to software projects becomes a cryptographically-verified credential that developers truly own.

## Monorepo Architecture

This repository contains two complementary Protocol Buffer modules that power the Cyberstorm ecosystem:

### üèõÔ∏è [Attestor Module](cyberstorm/attestor/v1/README.md)
**The Reputation Engine** - Core schemas for building verifiable professional reputation:

- **Identity System**: Cryptographic linkage between GitHub accounts and Ethereum addresses
- **Repository Registry**: On-chain repository registration with ownership proofs
- **Contribution Tracking**: Structured data for PRs, issues, and code reviews
- **Webhook Processing**: Real-time event processing from GitHub to blockchain

üìã **BSR**: [`buf.build/cyberstorm/attestor`](https://buf.build/cyberstorm/attestor)

### üîê [Crypto Module](cyberstorm/crypto/v1/README.md)
**IPLD Cryptographic Primitives** - Content-addressed data structures:

- **Content Identifiers (CID)**: Self-describing content addressing
- **Encryption Keys**: CEK/KEK management for secure content
- **Context References**: Building verifiable content graphs through IPLD links
- **Modern Standards**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for EVM ecosystems

üìã **BSR**: [`buf.build/cyberstorm/crypto`](https://buf.build/cyberstorm/crypto)

## How It Works: The Three-Step Reputation Network

### 1. **Decentralized Identity (DID) Registration**
Verifiably link your GitHub account to an Ethereum address, creating a cryptographic bridge between your development identity and blockchain-based credentials.

### 2. **Repository Registration** 
Project maintainers register their repositories on-chain, establishing them as legitimate sources of verifiable contributions within the reputation network.

### 3. **Contribution Attestation**
High-value contributions‚Äîpull requests, issue resolutions, code reviews‚Äîagainst registered repositories, by registered identities, are automatically attested on-chain through the [cyberstorm-attestor](https://github.com/cyberstorm-dev/attestor) service.

## Why This Matters for Developers

- **Portable Reputation**: Your verified contributions follow you across companies, platforms, and careers
- **Proof of Expertise**: Demonstrate technical skills with cryptographic proof, not just claims  
- **Network Effects**: Join an ecosystem where verified reputation creates measurable professional value
- **Future-Proof Career**: Build assets that appreciate as the reputation network grows

## Usage Examples

### Identity Registration (Attestor Module)

**TypeScript/JavaScript**
```typescript
import { Identity, Domain } from 'buf.build/cyberstorm/attestor';

// Register a GitHub identity with Ethereum address
const identity = new Identity({
  domain: new Domain({
    name: 'GitHub',
    domain: 'github.com'
  }),
  identifier: 'developer123',
  registrant: '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D16f5a2C01234567',
  proofUrl: 'https://gist.github.com/developer123/abc123...',
  validator: '0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac189451c24567'
});
```

### Content Addressing (Crypto Module)

**Python**
```python
from cyberstorm.crypto.v1 import CID, ContentEncryptionKey, EncryptionType

# Create self-describing content identifier
content_cid = CID(
    cid="bafkreig6mqa4p36x77qf5r3r7n4n4k3q3q3q3q3q3q3q3q3q3q3q3q3q"
)

# Set up content encryption
cek = ContentEncryptionKey(
    type=EncryptionType.ENCRYPTION_TYPE_CHACHA20_POLY1305,
    encrypted_key=b"encrypted_content_key_bytes..."
)
```

### Repository Registration (Attestor Module)

**Go**
```go
import attestorv1 "buf.build/cyberstorm/attestor/cyberstorm/attestor/v1"

// Register a repository for contribution tracking
repoRegistration := &attestorv1.Repository{
    Repository: &attestorv1.Repository{
        Domain: &attestorv1.Domain{
            Name:   "GitHub",
            Domain: "github.com",
        },
        Path: "awesome-org/amazing-project",
    },
    Registrant: registeredIdentity,
    ProofUrl:   "https://github.com/awesome-org/amazing-project/issues/42",
}
```

## Release Process

### Unified Release and Publish Workflow

The project uses a single GitHub Actions workflow for all release activities:

**To create a new release:**

1. Update version in all files to match (e.g., `1.0.5`):
   - `pyproject.toml` (project.version)
   - `package.json` (version)
   - `package-lock.json` (version)

2. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí **Release and Publish** ‚Üí **Run workflow**

3. Enter the version number **without "v" prefix** (e.g., `1.0.5`)

4. Select publishing options:
   - ‚òê **Publish to TestPyPI** (optional, for testing)
   - ‚òê **Publish to PyPI** (optional, for production)
   - ‚òê **Publish to Buf Schema Registry (BSR)** (optional, for proto schemas)
   - ‚òê **Publish to NPM Registry** (optional, for TypeScript/JavaScript)
   - ‚òê **Mark as prerelease** (optional)

**The workflow will:**
- ‚úÖ Validate version format and consistency across all files
- üèóÔ∏è Build and test all language bindings
- üè∑Ô∏è Create GitHub release with automatic "v" prefix (e.g., `v1.0.5`)
- üì¶ Upload TypeScript, Go, Python, and OpenAPI packages as release assets
- üêç Optionally publish Python package to TestPyPI and/or PyPI
- üì° Optionally publish Protocol Buffer schemas to Buf Schema Registry
- üì¶ Optionally publish TypeScript/JavaScript package to NPM Registry

**Version Format**: Always use semantic versioning without "v" prefix (e.g., `1.0.5`, `2.1.0-beta.1`)

### Required Secrets for Publishing

To enable optional publishing features, configure these repository secrets in Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions:

- **`TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`** - For TestPyPI publishing ([get token](https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/))
- **`PYPI_API_TOKEN`** - For PyPI publishing ([get token](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/))

### Join the Network

The value of the reputation network grows with each participant:

- **More registered repositories** = More opportunities to earn verifiable credentials
- **More registered developers** = Stronger network effects and reputation signals  
- **More platform adoption** = Greater utility for verified contributions

**Ready to build the future?** Start by integrating these schemas into your applications and contributing to the growing ecosystem of verifiable professional reputation.
