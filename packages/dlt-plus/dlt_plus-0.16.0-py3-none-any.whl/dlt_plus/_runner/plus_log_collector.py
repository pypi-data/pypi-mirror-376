    A basic collector-class that users can inherit from to implement their own callbacks
    The Four callbacks from SupportsTracking-Protocol are called during the pipeline
    execution:
    - on_start_trace(trace, step, pipeline)
    - on_start_trace_step(trace, step, pipline)
    - on_end_trace_step(trace, step, pipeline, step_info, send_state)
    - on_end_trace(trace, pipeline, send_state)
    one additional callback, called after load-stage, if schema update is detected:
    - on_schema_change(pipeline, trace, schema_name, changes)
    and three methods that get called from the PipelineRunner:
    - on_retry(pipeline, trace, retry_attempt, last_attempt, exception)
    - on_before(pipeline)
    - on_after(pipeline, trace, success, summary)
    The other methods are optional.
