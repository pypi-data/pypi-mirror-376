    "hitchhiker_search": """📚 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a comedic science fiction novel by Douglas Adams, published in 1979. It follows Arthur Dent's adventures through space after Earth is destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass.

The book is famous for introducing the number 42 as 'the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.' Here's a funny story: Douglas Adams wrote much of it in a hotel room in Innsbruck, Austria, after his editor literally locked him in until he finished it due to missed deadlines!

Rating: 4.8/5, 224 pages. It's become a cultural phenomenon with phrases like 'Don't panic!' entering popular culture.""",

    "austen_search": """📖 I have one book by Jane Austen in my collection: **Pride and Prejudice** (1813). It's a witty exploration of love, class, and social expectations in Regency England, with a rating of 4.7/5.

Fun fact: Austen originally titled it 'First Impressions' and it was rejected by publisher Thomas Cadell without even being read! He returned it immediately with 'declined by return of post.' Years later, publishers were begging for her work.""",

    "orwell_detailed": """📚 **1984** by George Orwell is a dystopian novel published in 1949 about totalitarian control and surveillance. It features Big Brother, Room 101, telescreens, and Newspeak.

Interesting backstory: Room 101 was named after a real BBC meeting room where Orwell had boring meetings! The telescreen concept was inspired by early BBC television. Originally, Orwell wanted to call it '1980' but his publisher thought that was too close to publication date, so he reversed '1948' to get '1984.'

Rating: 4.6/5, 328 pages."""
