    This is a first major release of OpenStackSDK.

    From now on interface can be considered stable and will also in future
    strictly follow SemVer model. This release includes work in ensuring
    methods and attribute naming are consistent across the code basis and first
    steps in implementing even more generalizations in the processing logic.

    Microversion support is now considered as stable and session will be
    established with the highest version supported by both client and server.

    This release includes work in enforcing consistency of the cloud layer
    methods. Now they all return SDK resource objects where previously Munch
    objects could have been returned. This leads to few important facts:

    - Return object types of various cloud.XXX calls now rely on proxy layer
      functions and strictly return SDK resources.
    - Some attributes of various resources may be named differently to
      follow SDK attribute naming convention.
    - Returned objects may forbid setting attributes (read-only attributes).

    Mentioned changes are affecting Ansible modules (which rely on
    OpenStackSDK). Historically Ansible modules return to the Ansible engine
    whatever SDK returns to it. Under some conditions Ansible may decide to
    unset properties (if it decides it contain sensitive information). While
    this is correct SDK forbids setting of some attributes what leads to
    errors. This release is therefore marking incompatibility with OpenStack
    Ansible modules in R1.X.X and the work on fixing it is being done in
    R2.X.X of modules repository.
