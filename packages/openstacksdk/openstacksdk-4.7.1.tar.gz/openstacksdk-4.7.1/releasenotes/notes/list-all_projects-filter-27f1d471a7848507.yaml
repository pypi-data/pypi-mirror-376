    A number of APIs support passing an admin-only ``all_projects`` filter when
    listing certain resources, allowing you to retrieve resources from all
    projects rather than just the current projects. This filter is now
    explicitly supported at the proxy layer for services and resources that
    support it. These are:

    * Block storage (v2)

      * ``find_snapshot``
      * ``snapshots``
      * ``find_volume``
      * ``volumes``

    * Block storage (v3)

      * ``find_snapshot``
      * ``snapshots``
      * ``find_volume``
      * ``volumes``

    * Compute (v2)

      * ``find_server``
      * ``find_server_group``
      * ``server_groups``

    * Workflow (v2)

      * ``find_cron_triggers``
      * ``cron_triggers``
