    The ``Resource.wait_for_status``, ``Resource.wait_for_delete``, and related
    proxy wrappers now accept a ``callback`` argument that can be used to pass
    a callback function. When provided, the wait function will attempt to
    retrieve a ``progress`` value from the resource in question and pass it to
    the callback function each time it iterates.
