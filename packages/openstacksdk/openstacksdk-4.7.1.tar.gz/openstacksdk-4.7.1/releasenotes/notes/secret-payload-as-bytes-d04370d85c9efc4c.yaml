features:
  - |
    For Barbican secrets with detected or provided content type other than
    "text/plain" SDK now returns the secret payload as raw bytes.
    For secrets with content type "text/plain", the payload is returned
    as string, decoded to UTF-8.
    This behavior is following python-barbicanclient, and allows to use
    SDK with Barbican secrets that have binary payloads
    (e.g. "application/octet-stream").
