    Changes the baremetal ``create_node`` call to be closer to how Ironic
    behaves. If no provision state is requested, the default state of the
    current microversion is used (which usually means ``enroll``).
    If the ``available`` state is requested, the node does not go through
    cleaning (it won't work without creating ports), an old API version is
    used to achieve this provision state.
