    Methods ``openstack.block_storage.v3.volume.Volume.init_attachment`` and
    ``block_storage.init_volume_attachment`` now return the results of the POST
    request instead of None. This replicates the behaviour of cinderclient; the
    returned data is used by nova and ironic for managing volume attachments.
