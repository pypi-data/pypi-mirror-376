deprecations:
  - |
    The following Compute service proxy methods are now deprecated:

    * ``find_image``
    * ``get_image``
    * ``delete_image``
    * ``images``

    These are proxy APIs for the Image service. You should use the Image
    service instead via the Image service proxy methods.
