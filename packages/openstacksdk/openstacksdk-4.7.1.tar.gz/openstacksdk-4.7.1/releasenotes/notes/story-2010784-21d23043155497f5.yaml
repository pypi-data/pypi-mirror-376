    Many cloud administrators use universal cloud-wide credentials. This is
    supported in keystone via 'inherited' roles that can be applied cloud-
    or domain-wide.

    In previous releases, these credentials could not be usefully defined
    within ```clouds.yaml``` because ```clouds.yaml``` supports only
    specifying a single domain and project for auth purposes. This project
    or domain could not be overridden on the commandline.
fixes:
  - |
    When some config settings are specified multiple times, the order of
    precendence has been changed to prefer command-line or env settings over
    those found in ```clouds.yaml```. The same reordering has been done when
    a setting is specified multiple times within ```clouds.yaml```; now a
    higher-level setting will take precedence over that specified within
    the auth section.

    Affected settings are:

    - ``domain_id``
    - ``domain_name``
    - ``user_domain_id``
    - ``user_domain_name``
    - ``project_domain_id``
    - ``project_domain_name``
    - ``auth-token``
    - ``project_id``
    - ``tenant_id``
    - ``project_name``
    - ``tenant_name``
