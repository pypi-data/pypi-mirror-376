    Added two filtering keys to ``QoSRuleType`` class query mapping, used for
    filtering the "list" command: "all_rules", to list all network QoS rule
    types implemented in Neutron, and "all_supported", to list all network QoS
    rule types supported by at least one networking mechanism driver.
