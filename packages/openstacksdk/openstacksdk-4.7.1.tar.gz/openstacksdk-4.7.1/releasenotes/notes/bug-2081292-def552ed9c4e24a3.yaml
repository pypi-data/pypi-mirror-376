    The ``update_quota_set`` methods in the Compute and Block Storage (v2, v3)
    proxy APIs were modified in v3.3.0 to accept ``Project`` objects as the
    first argument. A compatibility shim was included to handle callers still
    passing ``QuotaSet`` objects, but this shim did not modify the provided
    ``QuotaSet`` object in place as the previous code did. This has now been
    fixed. The shim is still expected to be removed in v5.0.0.
