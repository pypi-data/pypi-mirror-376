    Add BGP Speaker and BGP Peer resources, and introduce support for CRUD
    operations for these. Additional REST operations introduced for speakers:
    add_bgp_peer, remove_bgp_peer, add_gateway_network, remove_gateway_network,
    get_advertised_routes, get_bgp_dragents, add_bgp_speaker_to_draget,
    remove_bgp_speaker_from_dragent.
    One new REST method is added to agents to cover the features
    of Dynamic Routing Agents schedulers: get_bgp_speakers_hosted_by_dragent
