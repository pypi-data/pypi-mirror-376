    The signatures of the various volume attachment-related methods in the
    compute API proxy layer have changed. These were previously incomplete and
    did not function as expected in many scenarios. Some callers may need to be
    reworked. The affected proxy methods are:

    - ``create_volume_attachment``
    - ``delete_volume_attachment``
    - ``update_volume_attachment``
    - ``get_volume_attachment``
    - ``volume_attachments``
