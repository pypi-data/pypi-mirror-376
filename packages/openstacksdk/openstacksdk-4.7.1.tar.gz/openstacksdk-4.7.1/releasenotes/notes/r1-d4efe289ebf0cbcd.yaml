prelude: >
    This is a final R1.0 release of the OpenStackSDK. A few technical issues
    caused us not to reach this milestone cleanly, therefore we decided to one
    more time explicitly log everything what should be considered as R1.0. For
    detailed list of changes please see individual release notes from 0.99.0 to
    0.103.0. Most important changes are explicitly repeated here.  There were
    issues with maintainability of multiple available access interfaces, which
    forced us to consider what we are able to maintain in the long run and what
    we can not. That means that certain things were dropped, which is why we
    are releasing this as a major release.  R1.0 is considered as a first major
    release with corresponding promise regarding backwards-compatibility.
features:
  - |
    Cloud layer is now consistently returning ``Resource`` class objects.
    Previously this was not always the case.
  - |
    API response caching is implemented deep inside the code which will
    minimize roundtrips for repeated requests.
  - |
    The majority of services were verified and adapted to the latest state of
    the API.
  - |
    Certain code reorganization to further help in code reduction has been made
    (metadata, tag and quota support moved to standalone common classes).
upgrade:
  - |
    Cloud layer methods are returning ``Resource`` class objects instead of
    ``Munch`` objects.  In some cases this cause renaming of the attributes.
    ``Resource`` class is ``Munch`` compatible and allows both dictionary and
    attribute base access.
  - |
    Some historical methods, which were never properly tested were dropped.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``Munch`` is dropped as a dependency. The project has no releases since
    multiple years and was causing huge performance impact already during
    import. This has directly no negative imapct to SDK users (it now starts
    faster), but in the code we copied used ``Munch`` pieces. They are going to
    be consistently eliminated in next releases.
