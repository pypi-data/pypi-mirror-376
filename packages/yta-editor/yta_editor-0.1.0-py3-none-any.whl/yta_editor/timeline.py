"""
The timeline module that is the core
of this video editor. A group of 
tracks that include media items to
be played along the time.

A recommendation about formats to 
export:
- 'yuv420p': A final video without alpha
(to upload to Youtube or use in any
video player)
- 'yuva420p': A final video with alpha 
(to create overlays or assets we will
use in other videos)
- 'rgba': To process in memory with
alpha (numpy, OpenGL, PIL)
