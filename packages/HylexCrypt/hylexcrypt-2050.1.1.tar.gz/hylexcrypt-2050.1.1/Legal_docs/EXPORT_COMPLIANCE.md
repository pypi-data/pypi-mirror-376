# Export Compliance Notice (India)

This project includes **cryptographic software**.

### Indian Legal Context
Under Indian law, cryptography is **not restricted for domestic personal or commercial use**.  
However:
- Export of software containing cryptography may fall under the **Scomet List (Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment and Technologies)** controlled by the **Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT)**.
- In particular, **Category 8A5, 8A6, 8D** of SCOMET relates to "information security" and "cryptographic software".
- Export of strong cryptography (e.g., > 56-bit symmetric algorithms, public key algorithms > 512-bit) may require clearance.

### User Responsibility
It is your responsibility to **comply with all Indian laws and regulations** relating to cryptography, imports, and exports when using or distributing this software.

This software is made available **as open source** for civilian, educational, and commercial purposes. It is **not specifically designed for military use**.

### European Union
The EU regulates export of dual-use cryptographic items under **Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009**.  
Public-domain open-source software is generally exempt but local compliance may still apply.

### User Responsibility
You are solely responsible for **compliance with local and international laws** relating to cryptographic software when importing, using, or exporting this project.  
This project is intended for **civilian and educational use only** and is **not designed for military applications**.
