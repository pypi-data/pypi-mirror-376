### Expected triage timeline
We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**.
- Provide an initial triage update within **7 days**.
- Provide a remediation plan and timeline within **30 days**, or sooner if severity is high.

If a fix requires more time, we'll provide periodic updates.

## Disclosure policy
- Coordinated disclosure preferred.
- We will notify affected parties and provide a CVE when appropriate.
- After a fix is available, we will publish an advisory describing the issue, impact, and remediation steps.

## Severity guidelines (for triage)
- Critical: remote code execution, secret leakage, bypass of cryptographic protections.
- High: privilege escalation, persistent secret leakage.
- Medium: information disclosure with no immediate high impact.
- Low: minor issues or cosmetic problems.

## Safe reporting checklist
- Avoid publishing full exploit code in public communication before a fix.
- Provide enough detail to reproduce so we can triage.

## Other notes
- Do not include private keys or passwords in reports.
- By reporting a vulnerability you consent to the project contacting you for clarification.
