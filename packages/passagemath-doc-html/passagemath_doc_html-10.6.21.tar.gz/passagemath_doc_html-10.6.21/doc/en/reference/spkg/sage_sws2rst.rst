sage_sws2rst: Translate legacy Sage worksheet files (.sws) to reStructuredText (.rst) files
===========================================================================================

Description
-----------

Provides a script `sage-sws2rst`, which translates a Sage worksheet file (.sws) into a reStructuredText (.rst) file.

Sage worksheet files (.sws) are a file format that was used by the now-obsolete Sage notebook (https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb), superseded by the Jupyter notebook.  SageNB was dropped in the course of the transition of SageMath to Python 3.

This package was extracted from the SageNB sources in :issue:`28838` to provide a way to convert pedagogical material written available in Sage worksheet format.
