Tell me if the following question is Good or Bad, e.g. would it be unfair to ask this on a test.
It is good if it has an answer, if it not every single option is an answer, if it is not opinion based, if it does not have weasel words such as best, optimal, primary which would make many of the answers arguably true on some continuum of truth or opinion, or if the question is about numerical ephemeral truths, such as system limitations (max GB, etc) and UI defaults.
