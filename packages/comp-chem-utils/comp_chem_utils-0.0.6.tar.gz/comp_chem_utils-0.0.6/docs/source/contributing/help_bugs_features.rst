How to Help
===========

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

Write Documentation
-------------------

tutorials, and conceptual explanation. Check out :doc:`/contributing/doc_guide`
for instructions on how to start.

Provide Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to `file an issue`_. This is includes if you

  are welcome :)
