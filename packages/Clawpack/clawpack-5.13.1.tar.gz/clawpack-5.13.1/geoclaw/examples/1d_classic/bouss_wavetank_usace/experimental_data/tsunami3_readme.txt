The following explains the naming system used for measured ASCII data files acquired during 
tsunmai physica modeling experiments conducted at the Coastal and Hydraulic Laboratory, 
Engineer Research and Development Center.

Tsunami Benchmark #3: Runup of Solitary Waves on a Vertical Wall

Problem #3, "Runup of Solitary Waves on a Vertical Wall" 

The wave-paddle trajectories are stored in file FDBK3ABC.TXT.  A total of 10
sec from 22 to 32 sec (25 Hz sampling rate) is listed for each case in units of cm. 
Four columns are labeled "Time," "Case A,"  "Case B," "Case C." 

The surface elevation time series for gages 4 through 10 for cases A, B, and C
are stored in files TS3A.TXT, TS3B.TXT, and TS3C.TXT, respectively.  A total
of 30 sec of data from 265 to 295 sec is included for each case for the seven
gages in units of meters.  The time series were started 5 sec earlier (i.e. 265 sec
vs. 270 sec) as originally requested in the benchmark problem statement to
accommodate the passage of the wave at incident gage #4.  The eight columns
are labeled "Time", "G4_m", "G5_m", etc. 

Gage locations for Benchmark Problem #3 are listed below.  The origin is at the
wavemaker rest position with X positive down the flume and Y positive in the
transverse direction.  All gages were on the longitudinal centerline of the flume
(i.e. halfway across the flume width).

	 4C 	14.40     0.00     21.8     Incident gage, Case C
	 5      15.04     0.00     21.8

	 7      19.40     0.00     13.6   
	 8      20.86     0.00     12.6   
	 9      22.33     0.00     11.6   
	10      22.80     0.00      8.0            

Finally, file RUN3ABC.TXT contains the maximum recorded runup heights for
problem 3 for all three cases.  The five columns are labeled "Case," "Target
H/d," "Actual H/d," "Runup R, cm," and "R/d."
