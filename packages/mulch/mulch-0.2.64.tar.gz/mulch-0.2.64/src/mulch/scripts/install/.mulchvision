# 🌿 Mulch Manifesto: A Vision of Rooted Tools

	When you initialize a project with Mulch, you're not just shaping folders—you’re cultivating permanence, clarity, and empowerment. Mulch is built to feel obvious, not because it’s boring, but because it aligns with how creative, thoughtful people already want to work.
	
	You now have a way to weight your digital life—to treat structure as a shared language across time, across people, and across machines.

# ✨ What Mulch Offers
	• Scaffold, Don’t Shackle: Mulch sets up what’s needed, but never limits what’s possible.
	• Right-Click Revolution: Complex workflows now live under a single, respectful gesture.
	• Vision as Configuration: Your local .mulch-scaffold.toml holds team insight, habit, and hope—ready to sprout with one click.
	• Lock Files as Guardians: Every mulch.lock preserves context, integrity, and continuity. Think of it as a memory that travels with the project.
	• Project Genesis as a Social Gesture: The timestamp, author, and config aren’t just metadata—they’re an invitation to continue someone’s work, thoughtfully.

# 🤝 Values We Cultivate
	• Clarity over cleverness
	• Kindness over control
	• Empowerment over enforcement
	• Precision with flexibility
	• Consistency without rigidity

# 🌱 What This Folder Represents
	This workspace was born with intention. Its structure is not just technical—it is cultural. You are invited to contribute to that culture with integrity and care.
	
	Mulch is not magic—it’s mutualism. By using it, you help stabilize the infrastructure that others will depend on. By sharing it, you democratize creative autonomy for your team, your network, and yourself.
	
`Right click wisely.`
