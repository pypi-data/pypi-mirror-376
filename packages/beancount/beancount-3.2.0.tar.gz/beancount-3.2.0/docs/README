The pristine source for the documentation is located in Google Docs.
This allows users to collaborate and ask questions directly in the docs.
You can access the index for this documentation here:

  http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/index

Or, without a redirect, here (this is the same doc document):

  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaondTJCS_IUPBHFNdT8oqFKJjVJDsfsn6JEjBG04eA/

This directory will contain the future text conversion of the documentation for
Beancount. An attempt will be made to convert the Google Docs here in text
format, and so that they get published to beancount.github.io.
