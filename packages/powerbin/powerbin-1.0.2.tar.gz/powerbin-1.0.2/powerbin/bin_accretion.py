def accretion(xy, target_capacity, fun_capacity, verbose, args):
    """
    Generates initial bin centers using a bin-accretion algorithm.

    This function computes an initial set of bin generators used as a starting
    guess for the subsequent regularization step.  It implements the
    bin‑accretion algorithm of Cappellari & Copin (2003) [1], with algorithmic
    improvements that reduce the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N)
    (see Cappellari 2025 [2]).

    The algorithm proceeds as follows:
    1.  It starts by identifying the "brightest" (highest capacity) unbinned
        pixel to use as a seed for a new bin.
    2.  It then iteratively "accretes" the nearest unbinned neighboring
        pixels into the current bin.
    3.  Accretion for a bin stops when the bin is disconnected, becomes too
        non-circular, or its capacity starts moving away from the target.
    4.  A new bin is then seeded from the next brightest available pixel, and
        the process repeats until all pixels are binned.
    5.  Finally, pixels belonging to bins that failed to reach a significant
        fraction of the target capacity are reassigned to the nearest
        successful bin.

    Key differences from the original Cappellari & Copin (2003) algorithm:
    - **Neighbor Finding**: Pixel neighbors are pre-computed once using a
      Delaunay triangulation for efficiency, instead of being searched at
      each step.
    - **Bin Seeding**: A max-heap data structure is used to efficiently
      select the brightest unbinned pixel as the next seed in O(log N) time,
      which is a significant improvement over the original O(N) search.
    - **Stopping Criterion**: The accretion is guided by a generic `target_capacity`
      and stops when the bin's capacity overshoots or moves away from this
      target, rather than simply exceeding a signal-to-noise threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Coordinates of the pixels to be binned.
    target_capacity : float
        The target capacity for each bin.
    fun_capacity : callable
        Function to compute the capacity of a set of pixels, with the
        signature `fun_capacity(indices, *args)`.
    verbose : int, optional
        Controls the level of printed output (default is 1).
    args : tuple, optional
        Additional positional arguments to pass to `fun_capacity`.

    Returns
    -------
    xbin, ybin : np.ndarray
        Coordinates of the centroids of the generated bins.
    dens : np.ndarray
        The initial capacity density for each input pixel.
