# [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) (a Command Line IMAge eXplorer)

## Installing [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/)

We recommend that you install [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) as a tool using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

    $ uv tool install climax-rfglab

or

    $ uvx --from climax-rfglab climax

A [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) executable will be created in a bin directory in the PATH, which allows the tool to be run without uv. If the directory with the [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) executable is not in the PATH, a warning will be displayed and the following command can be issued to add it to the PATH:

    $ uv tool update-shell

[CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) can also be installed as a regular [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) package using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):  

    $ uv pip install climax-rfglab

or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en):

    $ python3 -m pip install climax-rfglab

### A note on the Python interpreter

[CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) requires that you have [Python 3.10 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

### A note for developers

If you want to download the code and run from source, you will first need to compile the part of 
[CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) that uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The simplest way to do that is to install [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) and run the following command within the [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) folder:

    $ maturin develop --release

After that, you can run [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) with:

    $ python -m climax.climax

## Using [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/)

After installing [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) with one of the methods above, You can invoke it with:

    $ climax <filename>

You can also run [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) without installing it, taking advantage of [uvx](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

    $ uvx --from climax-rfglab climax <filename>

There are a few ways to open an image with [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/):

- You can specifiy the path to the image that you want to open (e.g. *tests/cells_movie.tif*) :

        $ climax tests/cells_movie.tif

- Or you can indicate a folder (*slices* in this example) that contains an image sequence:

        $ climax ./slices

- If there are image channels split into different files, you can specify a group of substrings to distinguish which files in the folder belong to which channel. For example, to open the files in the *slices* folder containing the substrings '488' and '561' as two different channels:

        $ climax ./slices -s 488 561

- You can use a list of paths to concatenate sideways (i.e. display side-by-side, but all the images must have the same dimensions!!):

        $ climax cells_movie_1.tif cells_movie_2.tif

- You can specify the color map used to display the image. The color map defaults to *'gray'*. Check [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html) for a list of color maps.

        $ climax cells_movie.tif -c viridis

- Notice that if you try to open a color image, the channels will be split and displayed side-by-side (red, green, blue). Thus, for instance, if you open the [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) logo:

![Color](https://bytebucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/raw/3142f0d665a03f763b7c2d71a7b2f5b43eed3c59/docs/color_image_display.png)

- You can indicate the zoom factor initially used to display the image. The default value is 1.0, but you can select any of the values in **climax.zoom_factors** (currently 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 0.25 or 0.50):

        $ climax cells_movie.tif -z 2.0

[CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) provides a dashboard with additional functionality:

|name|function|
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
|rotate|rotate 90&deg; clockwise|
|flip h.|flip horizontally|
|flip v.|flip vertically|
|invert|invert color map|
|update|continuous/discrete update|
|x-y, z-y, z-x|slicing plane through stack|
|auto|automated contrast adjustment (min-mode, max-99th percentile)|

In addition to that, there is a command bar with additional functionality that can be invoked with the mouse or with several quick-keys:

|key|function|
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|
|.|next slice|
|,|previous slice|
|z|zoom, cycles between 2X, 4X, 0.25X, 0.50X and 1X, uses nearest-neighbour or bilinear interpolation|
|k|toggle dark mode on/off, initially off|
|t|open a new image|
|i|toggle bilinear interpolation on/off, initially off (i.e. nearest neighbour interpolation)|


# [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) today

As we develop and improve [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/), there may be small changes to the user interface. This is how [CLImax](https://bitbucket.org/rfg_lab/climax/src/master/) looks as of today:
