def csoundInitialize(signalHandler=True, atExitHandler=True) -> int:
    """Initializes Csound library with specific flags.

    This function is called internally by csoundCreate(), so there is generally
    no need to use it explicitly unless you need to avoid default initialization
    that sets signal handlers and atexit() callbacks.

    Within a python context, it is often necessary to call this function
    with `signalHandler=False` in order for csound not to obstruct
    python's own SIGINT (Keyboard Interrupt) handler

    Args:
        signalHandler: if True, add a signal handler
        atExitHandler: if True, adds a callback to destroy all instances of csound
            when exiting

    Returns:
        zero on success, positive if initialization was done already, and negative on error.
