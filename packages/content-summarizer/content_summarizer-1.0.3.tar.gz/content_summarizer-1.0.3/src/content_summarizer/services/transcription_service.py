"""Provides services for audio transcription.

This module offers functions for transcribing audio files using either
a local Whisper model or a remote transcription API. It encapsulates
the logic for both methods, handling model loading, API requests, and
error handling.

Functions:
    fetch_transcription_local: Transcribes audio using a local model.
    fetch_transcription_api: Transcribes audio using a remote API.
