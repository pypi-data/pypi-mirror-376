# Jtable

Jtable helps you render tables from key/value sources like JSON, YAML, and Python dictionaries.
It works as a CLI tool, a Jinja filter (usable in Ansible, Django, Flask, etc.), or a Python module.

  os: linux
  cost: 5000
  state: alive
  env: qua
- hostname: host_2
  os: linux
  cost: 5000
  state: alive
  env: qua
- hostname: host_3
  os: linux
  state: unreachable
  env: qua
```

```bash
cat host_dataset.yml | jtable
```

Output:
```text
hostname    os       cost  state        env
----------  -----  ------  -----------  -----
host_1      linux    5000  alive        qua
