## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install uv-packsize
```
## Usage

For help, run:
<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from uv_packsize import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: uv-packsize")
cog.out(

Usage: uv-packsize [OPTIONS] PACKAGE_NAME

  Report the size of a Python package and its dependencies using uv.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --dev      Include development dependencies in the size calculation.
  --bin      Include the size of binaries in the .venv/bin directory.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

```
<!-- [[[end]]] -->

You can also use:
```bash
python -m uv_packsize --help
```
## Development

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment using uv:
```bash
make sync
```

To run the tests:
```bash
make test
```

To run all formatting and linting, type check:
```bash
make check
```

this also runs [cog](https://cog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on README.md and updates the help message inside it.
