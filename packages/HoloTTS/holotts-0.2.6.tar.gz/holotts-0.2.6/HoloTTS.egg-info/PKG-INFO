# HoloTTS

## Overview

**HoloTTS** is a modern, thread-safe text-to-speech and audio processing manager for Python applications.
It provides real-time TTS synthesis, advanced audio manipulation, pipeline automation, and flexible playback for AI, productivity, and automation workflows.

**Highlights:**

* **Text-to-speech output:** Instantly generate speech from any text input.
* **Advanced audio handling:** Manipulate, convert, and normalize audio files and streams.
* **Flexible playback:** Directly play audio, control output devices, and manage volume.
* **Pipeline integration:** Designed for seamless use with batch and real-time audio workflows.
* **Thread-safe:** Safe for use in multi-threaded and production environments.
* **Easy to extend:** Clean interface for custom audio processing and integration.

## Why HoloTTS?

Standard TTS or audio modules are often limited to basic playback or export, and lack robust audio processing or automation.
**HoloTTS** solves these problems by combining:

* Seamless text-to-speech and audio processing in one interface.
* Real-time playback and device control.
* Advanced transformation and automation support.

---

## Key Features

* **Flexible TTS and Audio:**
  Convert text to speech, process and playback audio on demand.

* **Audio Manipulation:**
  Edit, slice, merge, and transform audio files and streams.

* **Pipeline-Ready:**
  Integrate with systems like `kokoro` for advanced batch and real-time audio workflows.

* **Configurable Playback:**
  Control volume, speed, and output devices as needed.

* **Production-Ready:**
  Robust error handling, state tracking, and thread safety for modern applications.
