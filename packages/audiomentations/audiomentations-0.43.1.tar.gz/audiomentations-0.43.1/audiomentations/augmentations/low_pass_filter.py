            When this is set to `True`, it will not affect the phase of the
            input signal but will sound 3 dB lower at the cutoff frequency
            compared to the non-zero phase case (6 dB vs. 3 dB). Additionally,
            it is twice as slow as the non-zero phase case. If you
            absolutely want no phase distortions (e.g. want to augment a
            drum track), set this to `True`.
