    Reverse the audio, also known as time inversion. Inversion of an audio track along its time axis is
    analogous to the random flip of an image, an augmentation technique widely used in the visual domain.
    This can be relevant in the context of audio classification. It was successfully applied in the paper
    AudioCLIP: Extending CLIP to Image, Text and Audio
