"""Constants and configuration values used throughout Ray Utilities.

Defines important constants, version checks, and configuration values used across
the Ray Utilities package. Includes version compatibility flags, metric keys for
Ray RLlib, Comet ML configuration, and video logging constants.

Key Constants:
    :data:`RAY_VERSION`: Current Ray version for compatibility checks
    :data:`RAY_NEW_API_STACK_ENABLED`: Whether Ray's new API stack is available
    :data:`EVAL_METRIC_RETURN_MEAN`: Standard evaluation return metric key
    :data:`DEFAULT_VIDEO_DICT_KEYS`: Video logging configuration keys
    :data:`COMET_OFFLINE_DIRECTORY`: Path for offline Comet ML experiments

Example:
    >>> from ray_utilities.constants import RAY_NEW_API_STACK_ENABLED
    >>> if RAY_NEW_API_STACK_ENABLED:
    ...     # Use new Ray API features
    ...     pass
