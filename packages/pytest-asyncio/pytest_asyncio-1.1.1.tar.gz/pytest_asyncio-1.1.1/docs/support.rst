Enterprise support
==================
`Tidelift <https://www.tidelift.com>`_ works with maintainers of numerous open source projects to ensure enterprise-grade support for your software supply chain.

The Tidelift subscription includes security updates, verified license compliance, continuous software maintenance, and more. As a result, you get the guarantees provided by commercial software for the open source packages you use.

Consider `signing up for the Tidelift subscription <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytest-asyncio?utm_source=pypi-pytest-asyncio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise>`__.


Direct maintainer support
=========================
If you require commercial support outside of the Tidelift subscription, reach out to `Michael Seifert, <https://seifertm.de>`__ one of the project's maintainers.


Community support
=================
The GitHub page of pytest-asyncio offers free community support on a best-effort basis. Please use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues>`__ to report bugs and the Matrix chat room `#pytest-asyncio:matrix.org <https://matrix.to/#/#pytest-asyncio:matrix.org>`__ or `GitHub discussions <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/discussions>`__ to ask questions.
