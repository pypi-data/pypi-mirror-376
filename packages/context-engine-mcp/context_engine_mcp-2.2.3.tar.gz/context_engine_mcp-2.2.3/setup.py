    long_description="""# IMPORTANT: Package Renamed to superflag

This package has been renamed. Installing this package will automatically install `superflag` instead.

## What Changed?

- **Old name**: `context-engine-mcp`
- **New name**: `superflag`
- **All functionality remains the same**

## Migration Steps

### For New Users
```bash
pip install superflag
```

### For Existing Users
No action needed! This package now installs `superflag` automatically.

### Command Compatibility
All commands work with both names:
- `superflag install` (recommended)
- `context-engine install` (backward compatible)

## Why the Change?

We've simplified the package name to make it easier to remember and use.
