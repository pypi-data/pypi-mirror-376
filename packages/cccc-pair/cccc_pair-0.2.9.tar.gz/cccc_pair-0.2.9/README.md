# CCCC Pair — Dual‑AI Orchestrator (Evidence‑first) · Agent‑as‑a‑Service (AaaS)

Two best‑in‑class AI CLIs (Claude Code + Codex CLI) co‑drive your work as equal peers. They collaborate, self‑review, and ship small, reversible changes with built‑in governance. You observe and nudge from tmux or IM. CCCC treats agents as long‑lived services — Agent‑as‑a‑Service (AaaS) — that speak the same contract, produce auditable evidence, and integrate with your team’s tools.

Not a chatbot UI. Not an IDE plugin. A production‑minded orchestrator for 24/7, long‑running work.

## Why It’s Different

- Dual‑AI Autonomy: peers continuously plan → build → critique → refine. They don’t wait for prompts; they follow a mailbox contract and change the world only with EVIDENCE (diff/tests/logs/benchmarks).
- Agent‑as‑a‑Service (AaaS): agents are long‑running services with a mailbox contract, not ad‑hoc prompts. They keep rhythm, produce evidence, and integrate with IM (Telegram/Slack/Discord via bridges; Teams outbound planned) without coupling core logic to any single transport.
- IM Collaboration: a 24/7 agent lives in your team chat. High‑signal summaries, one‑tap RFD decisions, explicit routing (a:/b:/both:) so normal conversation remains normal. Files flow both ways with captions and sidecars.
- Builder–Critic Synergy: peers challenge CLAIMs with COUNTERs and converge via verifiable EVIDENCE. In practice this beats single‑model quality on complex, multi‑day tasks.
- tmux Transparency: dual panes (PeerA/PeerB) + compact status panel. You can peek, nudge, or inject text without disrupting flows—and without a GUI.
- Governance at the Core (RFD): protected areas and irreversible changes raise Request‑For‑Decision cards in chat; approvals are written to a ledger and unlock execution.
- Team‑level Efficiency: one always‑on bot concentrates orchestration and approvals for the whole team. You reduce duplicated “per‑seat” sessions and still retain control.

## What You Get

- Evidence‑first loop: tiny diffs/tests/logs; only green changes commit.
- Single‑branch queue: preflight `git apply` → (optional) lint/tests → commit.
- RFD closed loop: generate cards, gate protected paths/large diffs, unlock on decision.
- AaaS integration: explicit routing; `/status`, `/queue`, `/locks`, `/rfd list|show`, `/showpeers on|off`, file send/receive with meta. Bridges mirror events; orchestrator remains transport‑agnostic.
- Ledger: append‑only `.cccc/state/ledger.jsonl` (patch/test/log/decision) for audit.

## Requirements

- Python `>= 3.9`
- tmux (e.g., `brew install tmux` or `sudo apt install tmux`)
- git (preflight/commits)

Supported CLIs (current)
- Peer A: Claude Code CLI (recommended: MAX Plan)
- Peer B: Codex CLI (recommended: PRO Plan)

## Install

- Recommended (pipx)
  - `pipx install cccc-pair`
- Or venv
  - `python3 -m venv v && . v/bin/activate && pip install cccc-pair`

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1) Initialize in your project repo

```
cccc init
```

This copies the scaffold to `./.cccc/` and appends `/.cccc/**` to `.gitignore` (Ephemeral).

2) Check environment

```
cccc doctor
```

3) (Optional) Enable Telegram

```
cccc token set   # paste your bot token; stored in .cccc/settings/telegram.yaml (gitignored)
```

4) Run orchestrator (tmux UI)

```
cccc run
```

tmux opens: left/right = PeerA/PeerB, bottom‑right = status panel.
Run wizard (interactive TTY) lets you optionally connect a bridge:
- 1) Local only (default)
- 2) Local + Telegram
- 3) Local + Slack
- 4) Local + Discord
You can also manage bridges later via `cccc bridge …` or set `autostart` in `.cccc/settings/*.yaml`.

5) First‑time CLI setup (required)

- Install the two CLIs and make sure the binaries are on PATH:
  - `claude ...` (Claude Code)
  - `codex ...` (Codex CLI)
- Paste system prompts for best collaboration quality:
  - Open `PEERA.md` and copy its full content into a new file `CLAUDE.md` at your repo root (not tracked; `.gitignore` already ignores it). Claude Code CLI should load this as its system prompt.
  - Open `PEERB.md` and copy its full content into a new file `AGENTS.md` at your repo root (not tracked). Codex CLI should load this as its system prompt.
- Move any previous “project state” prompt into `PROJECT.md` at the repo root (recommended). The orchestrator will weave this into the runtime SYSTEM so both peers align on scope and goals.
- Verify or adjust the CLI commands in `.cccc/settings/cli_profiles.yaml`:
  - `commands.peerA: "claude ..."`
  - `commands.peerB: "codex ..."`
  - You can also override at runtime with env vars: `CLAUDE_I_CMD`, `CODEX_I_CMD`.

## First Landing Checklist (Minimal)

Do just these to get a clean, working setup:

1) `cccc init` (creates `./.cccc` and ignores runtime dirs)
2) `cccc doctor` (git/tmux/python)
3) Prepare system prompts (required once per repo)
   - Copy `PEERA.md` → `CLAUDE.md` (root)
   - Copy `PEERB.md` → `AGENTS.md` (root)
   - Put your brief/scope in `PROJECT.md` (root)
4) Optional Telegram (highly recommended)
   - `cccc token set`
   - `cccc run` (bridge autostarts) or `cccc bridge start`
5) Start work: `cccc run` (tmux panes + status panel)

That’s it. You can refine policies later.

## IM Quickstart (Team Hub)

- Group routing: use explicit routes so normal chat stays normal
  - `a: <text>` / `b: <text>` / `both: <text>`
  - or `/a ...` `/b ...` `/both ...` (works with privacy mode)
- Get oriented
  - `/status` project stats; `/queue` handoff queue; `/locks` internal locks
  - `/whoami` shows your chat_id; `/subscribe` (if `autoregister: open`)
  - `/showpeers on|off` toggles Peer↔Peer summaries
- File exchange
  - Outbound (AIs → IM): save files to `.cccc/work/upload/outbound/` (flat)
  - Routing: either a `<name>.route` sidecar with `a|b|both`, or the first line of `<name>.caption.txt` starts with `a:`/`b:`/`both:` (the prefix is removed from the caption)
  - ACK: on success, a `<name>.sent.json` sidecar is written
  - Inbound (IM → AIs): bridge writes `<FROM_USER>` with sidecar meta; peers act on it
- Governance: RFD cards in chat with Approve/Reject; decisions go to the ledger and unlock execution.

## A Typical Session (End‑to‑End, ~3 minutes)

Goal: ship a small, reversible change with dual‑AI collaboration.

1) Explore (short)
- In Telegram (or tmux), route a brief idea to both: `both: Add a section to README about team chat tips`
- PeerA summarizes intent; PeerB asks 1 focused question if needed.

2) Decide (concise CLAIM)
- PeerA writes a CLAIM in `peerA/to_peer.md` with acceptance and constraints (≤150 lines; links to where to edit).
- PeerB COUNTERs if there’s a sharper place or a safer rollout.

3) Build (evidence‑first)
- PeerB produces a tiny unified diff in `peerB/patch.diff` (e.g., add a new README subsection) and a 1–2 line EVIDENCE note (tests OK/lines/paths/MID).
- Orchestrator preflights → applies → (optional) lint/tests → commits on green and logs to ledger.

4) Team visibility
- Telegram posts a concise summary (debounced); peers stay quiet unless blocked.
- If you need files (screenshots/spec PDFs), drop them to the bot with a caption; peers act on the inbound block with meta.

RFD is not required here. It triggers automatically only for protected areas or when you explicitly ask for a decision.

## Recommended Stack (Pragmatic & Stable)

- AI CLIs: Claude Code (MAX Plan) + Codex CLI (PRO Plan) for robust, sustained workloads.
- Orchestrator: this project, with tmux for long‑lived panes and a compact panel.
- Transport & Governance: Telegram for team‑wide visibility, quick RFD decisions, and file exchange.

## CLI Reference

- `cccc init [--force] [--to PATH]` — copy scaffold; preserves layout; excludes runtime dirs
- `cccc doctor` — check git/tmux/python/telegram
- `cccc run` — start orchestrator (tmux panes + status panel; optional bridge connect wizard; autostarts per YAML)
- `cccc token set|unset|show` — manage Telegram token (gitignored)
- `cccc bridge <telegram|slack|discord|all> start|stop|status|restart|logs [-n N] [--follow]` — control/inspect bridges
- `cccc clean` — purge `.cccc/{mailbox,work,logs,state}/`
- `cccc version` — show package version and scaffold path info

Adapter dependencies (optional)
- Slack bridge requires `slack_sdk` (install via `pip install slack_sdk`).
- Discord bridge requires `discord.py` (install via `pip install discord.py`).
If these packages or tokens are missing, adapters exit fast with a clear error. Slack inbound requires an App token (Socket Mode) while outbound requires a Bot token.

CLI prerequisites (summary)
- Peer A = Claude Code; Peer B = Codex CLI. Install and log in as required by each vendor.
- Ensure the binaries (`claude`, `codex`) are on PATH or set `commands.peer*`/`CLAUDE_I_CMD`/`CODEX_I_CMD`.

## Feature Overview (selected)

- Bridges: Telegram (inbound/outbound), Slack (Socket Mode + Web API, MVP), Discord (Gateway + REST, MVP). Outbound reads single‑source Outbox (`.cccc/state/outbox.jsonl`) via a shared consumer; inbound routes `a:/b:/both:` to mailbox inbox. No dry‑run: tokens/SDKs are required and adapters fail fast when missing.
- Unified bridge CLI: `cccc bridge <telegram|slack|discord|all> start|stop|status|restart|logs` and an optional connect wizard in `cccc run`. Bridges can autostart via YAML.
- Context maintenance: on a cadence (config `delivery.context_compact_every_self_checks`), send `/compact` to both CLIs and immediately reinject the full SYSTEM with a leading “Now: … TZ” line.
- Self‑check enhancements: inject current time/TZ; add an insight‑channel reminder to generate new angles (hook/assumption/risk/trade‑off/next/delta) rather than restating.
- NUDGE improvements: exponential backoff, jitter, progress timeout; guidance for productive action when inbox is empty.
- REV gate: after a COUNTER/QUESTION, the next to_peer must be a valid revise (insight.kind=revise with delta/refs/next and not restating) or carry direct evidence (inline unified diff). Otherwise the message is intercepted with a short tip and logged.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**tmux panes not appearing?**
- Install tmux (`tmux -V`), run in a TTY, then `cccc run`. Check `cccc doctor`.

**Telegram bot silent?**
- `cccc token show` (token saved?) → `cccc bridge status` (running?) → `cccc bridge logs -n 200`
- In group chats, route explicitly (`a:`/`/a`), and run `/whoami` or `/subscribe` once to register
- Ensure `autostart: true`

**Claude/Codex CLI not found?**
- Install the CLIs and make sure the binaries are on PATH; otherwise set explicit commands:
  - Edit `.cccc/settings/cli_profiles.yaml` (`commands.peerA|peerB`) or
  - Export env vars before `cccc run`: `CLAUDE_I_CMD="/path/to/claude ..."`, `CODEX_I_CMD="/path/to/codex ..."`

**Where to put my project brief/policies?**
- Put your project scope/brief in `PROJECT.md` (repo root). The orchestrator injects it into the runtime SYSTEM so both peers align.
- RFD/protected paths live in `.cccc/settings/policies.yaml`.

**“This environment is externally managed” during install/build?**
- Use a venv or pipx for publishing; avoid system Python for `pip install` of tools like build/twine.

**RFD card not shown?**
- Confirm ledger has `kind:rfd`; check bridge logs; verify gates and to_peer YAML format.

## Security & Privacy

- Telegram token saved to `.cccc/settings/telegram.yaml` (gitignored) or env; do not commit secrets.
- Bridge redacts common secret patterns; keep mailbox content free of tokens.
- Orchestrator domain `.cccc/**` is runtime; do not commit `state/logs/work/mailbox`.

## Roadmap (Selected)

- Role‑based approvals; multi‑sign gates; richer RFD templates with default options/expiry
- Artifact previews in chat; repro snippets; CI/CD hooks for release/rollback cards
- Optional safety scanners (ClamAV/DLP) for inbound files; Slack/Mattermost bridges
