           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

# CCCC Pair — Dual‑AI Orchestrator (Evidence‑first) · Agent‑as‑a‑Service (AaaS)

Two best‑in‑class AI CLIs (Claude Code + Codex CLI) co‑drive your work as equal peers. They collaborate, self‑review, and ship small, reversible changes with built‑in governance. You observe and nudge from tmux or IM. CCCC treats agents as long‑lived services — Agent‑as‑a‑Service (AaaS) — that speak the same contract, produce auditable evidence, and integrate with your team’s tools.

Not a chatbot UI. Not an IDE plugin. A production‑minded orchestrator for 24/7, long‑running work.

## Why It’s Different

- Dual‑AI Autonomy: peers continuously plan → build → critique → refine. They don’t wait for prompts; they follow a mailbox contract and change the world only with EVIDENCE (diff/tests/logs/benchmarks).
- Agent‑as‑a‑Service (AaaS): agents are long‑running services with a mailbox contract, not ad‑hoc prompts. They keep rhythm, produce evidence, and integrate with IM (Telegram/Slack/Discord via bridges; Teams outbound planned) without coupling core logic to any single transport.
- IM Collaboration: a 24/7 agent lives in your team chat. High‑signal summaries, one‑tap RFD decisions, explicit routing (a:/b:/both:) so normal conversation remains normal. Files flow both ways with captions and sidecars.
- Builder–Critic Synergy: peers challenge CLAIMs with COUNTERs and converge via verifiable EVIDENCE. In practice this beats single‑model quality on complex, multi‑day tasks.
- tmux Transparency: dual panes (PeerA/PeerB) + compact status panel. You can peek, nudge, or inject text without disrupting flows—and without a GUI.
- Governance at the Core (RFD): protected areas and irreversible changes raise Request‑For‑Decision cards in chat; approvals are written to a ledger and unlock execution.
- Team‑level Efficiency: one always‑on bot concentrates orchestration and approvals for the whole team. You reduce duplicated “per‑seat” sessions and still retain control.

## What You Get

- Evidence‑first loop: tiny diffs/tests/logs; only green changes commit.
- Single‑branch queue: preflight `git apply` → (optional) lint/tests → commit.
- RFD closed loop: generate cards, gate protected paths/large diffs, unlock on decision.
- AaaS integration: explicit routing; `/status`, `/queue`, `/locks`, `/rfd list|show`, `/showpeers on|off`, file send/receive with meta. Bridges mirror events; orchestrator remains transport‑agnostic.
- Ledger: append‑only `.cccc/state/ledger.jsonl` (patch/test/log/decision) for audit.

## Requirements

- Python `>= 3.9`
- tmux (e.g., `brew install tmux` or `sudo apt install tmux`)
- git (preflight/commits)

Supported CLIs (current)
- Peer A: Claude Code CLI (recommended: MAX Plan)
- Peer B: Codex CLI (recommended: PRO Plan)

## Install

- Recommended (pipx)
  - `pipx install cccc-pair`
- Or venv
  - `python3 -m venv v && . v/bin/activate && pip install cccc-pair`

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1) Initialize in your project repo

```
cccc init
```

This copies the scaffold to `./.cccc/` and appends `/.cccc/**` to `.gitignore` (Ephemeral).

2) Check environment

```
cccc doctor
```

3) (Optional) Enable Telegram

```
cccc token set   # paste your bot token; stored in .cccc/settings/telegram.yaml (gitignored)
```

4) Run orchestrator (tmux UI)

```
cccc run
```

tmux opens: left/right = PeerA/PeerB, bottom‑right = status panel.
Run wizard (interactive TTY) lets you optionally connect a bridge:
- 1) Local only (default)
- 2) Local + Telegram
- 3) Local + Slack
- 4) Local + Discord
You can also manage bridges later via `cccc bridge …` or set `autostart` in `.cccc/settings/*.yaml`.

5) First‑time CLI setup (required)

- Install the two CLIs and make sure the binaries are on PATH:
  - `claude ...` (Claude Code)
  - `codex ...` (Codex CLI)
- Paste system prompts for best collaboration quality:
  - Open `PEERA.md` and copy its full content into a new file `CLAUDE.md` at your repo root (not tracked; `.gitignore` already ignores it). Claude Code CLI should load this as its system prompt.
  - Open `PEERB.md` and copy its full content into a new file `AGENTS.md` at your repo root (not tracked). Codex CLI should load this as its system prompt.
- Move any previous “project state” prompt into `PROJECT.md` at the repo root (recommended). The orchestrator will weave this into the runtime SYSTEM so both peers align on scope and goals.
- Verify or adjust the CLI commands in `.cccc/settings/cli_profiles.yaml`:
  - `commands.peerA: "claude ..."`
  - `commands.peerB: "codex ..."`
  - You can also override at runtime with env vars: `CLAUDE_I_CMD`, `CODEX_I_CMD`.

## First Landing Checklist (Minimal)

Do just these to get a clean, working setup:

1) `cccc init` (creates `./.cccc` and ignores runtime dirs)
2) `cccc doctor` (git/tmux/python)
3) Prepare system prompts (required once per repo)
   - Copy `PEERA.md` → `CLAUDE.md` (root)
   - Copy `PEERB.md` → `AGENTS.md` (root)
   - Put your brief/scope in `PROJECT.md` (root)
4) Optional Telegram (highly recommended)
   - `cccc token set`
   - `cccc run` (bridge autostarts) or `cccc bridge start`
5) Start work: `cccc run` (tmux panes + status panel)

That’s it. You can refine policies later.

## IM Quickstart (Team Hub)

- Group routing: use explicit routes so normal chat stays normal
  - `a: <text>` / `b: <text>` / `both: <text>`
  - or `/a ...` `/b ...` `/both ...` (works with privacy mode)
- Get oriented
  - `/status` project stats; `/queue` handoff queue; `/locks` internal locks
  - `/whoami` shows your chat_id; `/subscribe` (if `autoregister: open`)
  - `/showpeers on|off` toggles Peer↔Peer summaries
- File exchange
  - Outbound (AIs → IM): save files to `.cccc/work/upload/outbound/` (flat)
  - Routing: either a `<name>.route` sidecar with `a|b|both`, or the first line of `<name>.caption.txt` starts with `a:`/`b:`/`both:` (the prefix is removed from the caption)
  - ACK: on success, a `<name>.sent.json` sidecar is written
  - Inbound (IM → AIs): bridge writes `<FROM_USER>` with sidecar meta; peers act on it
- Governance: RFD cards in chat with Approve/Reject; decisions go to the ledger and unlock execution.

## A Typical Session (End‑to‑End, ~3 minutes)

Goal: ship a small, reversible change with dual‑AI collaboration.

1) Explore (short)
- In Telegram (or tmux), route a brief idea to both: `both: Add a section to README about team chat tips`
- PeerA summarizes intent; PeerB asks 1 focused question if needed.

2) Decide (concise CLAIM)
- PeerA writes a CLAIM in `peerA/to_peer.md` with acceptance and constraints (≤150 lines; links to where to edit).
- PeerB COUNTERs if there’s a sharper place or a safer rollout.

3) Build (evidence‑first)
- PeerB produces a tiny unified diff in `peerB/patch.diff` (e.g., add a new README subsection) and a 1–2 line EVIDENCE note (tests OK/lines/paths/MID).
- Orchestrator preflights → applies → (optional) lint/tests → commits on green and logs to ledger.

4) Team visibility
- Telegram posts a concise summary (debounced); peers stay quiet unless blocked.
- If you need files (screenshots/spec PDFs), drop them to the bot with a caption; peers act on the inbound block with meta.

RFD is not required here. It triggers automatically only for protected areas or when you explicitly ask for a decision.

## Recommended Stack (Pragmatic & Stable)

- AI CLIs: Claude Code (MAX Plan) + Codex CLI (PRO Plan) for robust, sustained workloads.
- Orchestrator: this project, with tmux for long‑lived panes and a compact panel.
- Transport & Governance: Telegram for team‑wide visibility, quick RFD decisions, and file exchange.

- Slack bridge requires `slack_sdk` (install via `pip install slack_sdk`).
- Discord bridge requires `discord.py` (install via `pip install discord.py`).
If these packages or tokens are missing, adapters exit fast with a clear error. Slack inbound requires an App token (Socket Mode) while outbound requires a Bot token.

CLI prerequisites (summary)
- Peer A = Claude Code; Peer B = Codex CLI. Install and log in as required by each vendor.
- Ensure the binaries (`claude`, `codex`) are on PATH or set `commands.peer*`/`CLAUDE_I_CMD`/`CODEX_I_CMD`.

## Feature Overview (selected)

- Bridges: Telegram (inbound/outbound), Slack (Socket Mode + Web API, MVP), Discord (Gateway + REST, MVP). Outbound reads single‑source Outbox (`.cccc/state/outbox.jsonl`) via a shared consumer; inbound routes `a:/b:/both:` to mailbox inbox. No dry‑run: tokens/SDKs are required and adapters fail fast when missing.
- Unified bridge CLI: `cccc bridge <telegram|slack|discord|all> start|stop|status|restart|logs` and an optional connect wizard in `cccc run`. Bridges can autostart via YAML.
- Context maintenance: on a cadence (config `delivery.context_compact_every_self_checks`), send `/compact` to both CLIs and immediately reinject the full SYSTEM with a leading “Now: … TZ” line.
- Self‑check enhancements: inject current time/TZ; add an insight‑channel reminder to generate new angles (hook/assumption/risk/trade‑off/next/delta) rather than restating.
- NUDGE improvements: exponential backoff, jitter, progress timeout; guidance for productive action when inbox is empty.
- REV gate: after a COUNTER/QUESTION, the next to_peer must be a valid revise (insight.kind=revise with delta/refs/next and not restating) or carry direct evidence (inline unified diff). Otherwise the message is intercepted with a short tip and logged.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**tmux panes not appearing?**
- Install tmux (`tmux -V`), run in a TTY, then `cccc run`. Check `cccc doctor`.

**Telegram bot silent?**
- `cccc token show` (token saved?) → `cccc bridge status` (running?) → `cccc bridge logs -n 200`
- In group chats, route explicitly (`a:`/`/a`), and run `/whoami` or `/subscribe` once to register
- Ensure `autostart: true`

**Claude/Codex CLI not found?**
- Install the CLIs and make sure the binaries are on PATH; otherwise set explicit commands:
  - Edit `.cccc/settings/cli_profiles.yaml` (`commands.peerA|peerB`) or
  - Export env vars before `cccc run`: `CLAUDE_I_CMD="/path/to/claude ..."`, `CODEX_I_CMD="/path/to/codex ..."`

**Where to put my project brief/policies?**
- Put your project scope/brief in `PROJECT.md` (repo root). The orchestrator injects it into the runtime SYSTEM so both peers align.
- RFD/protected paths live in `.cccc/settings/policies.yaml`.

**“This environment is externally managed” during install/build?**
- Use a venv or pipx for publishing; avoid system Python for `pip install` of tools like build/twine.

**RFD card not shown?**
- Confirm ledger has `kind:rfd`; check bridge logs; verify gates and to_peer YAML format.

## Security & Privacy

- Telegram token saved to `.cccc/settings/telegram.yaml` (gitignored) or env; do not commit secrets.
- Bridge redacts common secret patterns; keep mailbox content free of tokens.
- Orchestrator domain `.cccc/**` is runtime; do not commit `state/logs/work/mailbox`.

## Roadmap (Selected)

- Role‑based approvals; multi‑sign gates; richer RFD templates with default options/expiry
- Artifact previews in chat; repro snippets; CI/CD hooks for release/rollback cards
- Optional safety scanners (ClamAV/DLP) for inbound files; Slack/Mattermost bridges
