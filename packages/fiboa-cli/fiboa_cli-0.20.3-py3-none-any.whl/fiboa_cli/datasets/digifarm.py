# Digifarm converter for fiboa
# First draft just takes in a file saved from the API.
# It'd be ideal if there was a CLI that took a Digifarm token and BBOX and would save the file locally and
# convert it. Not sure if we want to keep loading functionality into the converter, if we have a new
# CLI tool that could query field boundary API's - I'd see DigiFarm and Onesoil as options, where you could
# do like 'fiboa api-request digifarm --bbox 4,12,5,13 --token blah | fiboa convert digifarm -i -'.
