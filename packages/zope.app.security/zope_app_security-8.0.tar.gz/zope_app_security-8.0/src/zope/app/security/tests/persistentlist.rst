"""Persistent List functional tests.
"""

Let's check that we can access the data attribute of a proxied
PersistentList. This is to accomodate UserList operations which are
used when an isinstance call will correctly identify a persistent list
as a UserList. Some configurations may get incorrect behavior currently,
such that isinstance claims that a proxied UserList is not a UserList.
For these configurations this should not make a difference.

Because several UserList methods use this isinstance check before
accessing the data attribute we will simply try to get the data
attribute from a proxied example.

    >>> import persistent.list
    >>> import zope.security.tests.test_proxy
    >>> import zope.security.proxy

    >>> persistent_list = persistent.list.PersistentList()

    >>> proxied_list = zope.security.proxy.ProxyFactory(
    ...     persistent_list)

    >>> proxied_list.data
    []

We'll do the same with a persistent mapping, which follows the same
behavior pattern with UserDict.

    >>> import persistent.mapping
    >>> persistent_mapping = persistent.mapping.PersistentMapping()

    >>> proxied_mapping = zope.security.proxy.ProxyFactory(
    ...     persistent_mapping)

    >>> proxied_mapping.data
    {}
