"""IQM Circuit to Pulse Compiler.

IQM Circuit to Pulse Compiler is a Python-based library for converting quantum circuits
into :class:`instruction schedules <exa.pulse.pulse_schedule.PulseSchedule>`
(which map ``Station Control`` controller names to their pulse playlists) and Station Control settings
required for circuit execution, using the calibration data it is given.
The generated schedules and settings can be sent to Station Control
for execution on real or simulated quantum hardware.

CPC is normally only accessed indirectly through Cocos or its reference client
`IQM client <https://docs.meetiqm.com/iqm-client/index.html>`_,
or a frontend such as
`Cirq on IQM <https://docs.meetiqm.com/iqm-client/user_guide_cirq.html>`_ or
`Qiskit on IQM <https://docs.meetiqm.com/iqm-client/user_guide_qiskit.html>`_.
