# SonicParanoid
> Fast, accurate, and comprehensive orthology inference with machine learning and language models

## Description

SonicParanoid is a stand-alone software for the identification of orthologous relationships among multiple species. SonicParanoid is an open source software released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.0 ([GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)), implemented in Python3, Cython, and C++. It works on Linux and Mac OSX.

### Fast and Scalable
SonicParanoid is able to infer the orthologs for hundres of prokaryotes in hours, or days for eukaryotes, using a desktop computer with 8 CPUs. This figure is much smaller when running on HPC servers with dozens of CPUs (e.g. <1h for the [QfO benchmark](https://questfororthologs.org/) datasets).
It is also highly scalable, as it inferred the orthologs for 2000 MAGs in only 1 day using 128 CPUs.

### Fast and scalable domain-aware orthology inference
SonicParanoid uses language models to infer orthologs at the domain level. The Artificial Neural Networks are directly trained on the input proteome set and it show a quasi-linear scalability on the number of input proteomes.

### Accurate
SonicParanoid was tested using a benchmark proteome dataset from the [Quest for Orthologs consortium](https://questfororthologs.org/), and the correctness of its predictions was evaluated using a standardized [Orthology Benchmarking service](https://orthology.benchmarkservice.org).
SonicParanoid showed a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, with an accuracy comparable to those of well-established inference methods.

### Easy to use
Thanks to its speed, accuracy, and usability SonicParanoid substantially relieves the difficulties of orthology inference for biologists who need to construct and maintain their own genomic datasets.
