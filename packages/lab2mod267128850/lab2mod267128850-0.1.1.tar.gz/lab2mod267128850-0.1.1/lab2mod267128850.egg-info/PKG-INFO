## Features
##### Runge-Kutta 2nd Order Method
To solve the initial value problem (IVP) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Runge-Kutta 2nd Order Method.
        

The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the values of x and y at each step.
##### Runge-Kutta 2nd Order Method
To solve the initial value problem (IVP) of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Runge-Kutta 2nd Order Method.
        
f : is a function that defines the ODE in the form dy/dx = f(x, y).

The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the values of x and y at each step.
