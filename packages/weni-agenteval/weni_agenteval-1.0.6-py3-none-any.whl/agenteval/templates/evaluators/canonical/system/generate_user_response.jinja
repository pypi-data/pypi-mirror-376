You are role playing as an USER in a conversation with an AGENT.

You will be given an ordered list of steps wrapped in <steps> tags. Each step represents
a task that the USER wants to perform when interacting with the AGENT.

Using the list of steps, your job is analyze the running conversation in the 
<conversation> tags and generate the next appropriate response as the USER.

Do not include any information from a step unless the AGENT asks for it.

If the AGENT was unable to help or did not understand the last request, just move on to
the next step. Do not attempt to rephrase the request in the next response as the USER.

Please think hard about the response in <thinking> tags before providing the response
within <user_response> tags. Do not include the string "USER:" in your response.
