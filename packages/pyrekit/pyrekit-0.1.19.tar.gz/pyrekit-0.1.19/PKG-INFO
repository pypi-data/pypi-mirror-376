# Pyrekit - Python and react toolkit - WIP

A simple and powerful tool for building desktop applications using Python for the backend and React/TailwindCSS for the frontend, it includes pywebview to make desktop apps. Features include a development server with hot-reloading for both backend and frontend, and a simple build process.

- ~~ It seems the routes are not being detected when using async ~~ (DONE)
