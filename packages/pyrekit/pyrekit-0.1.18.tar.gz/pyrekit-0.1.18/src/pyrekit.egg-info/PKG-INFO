# Pyrekit - Python and react toolkit - WIP

A simple and powerful tool for building desktop applications using Python for the backend and React/TailwindCSS for the frontend, it includes pywebview to make desktop apps. Features include a development server with hot-reloading for both backend and frontend, and a simple build process.

## TODOs:
- Make it work without packing, so that it can be used as a server without a webview.
- Make it work over https.
- ~~Solve: It seems its not hot reloading and not updating the server.ts with the routes handlers~~ (DONE)
