# WhatsApp Web Python Client

A Python client for interacting with WhatsApp Web using Playwright.

## Features

* QR code authentication
* Event-based architecture with `EventEmitter`
* Supports multiple authentication methods:

  * `NoAuth` (QR-based login)
  * `LegacySessionAuth` (planned)
  * `LocalAuth` (planned)
* Playwright-based browser automation

## Usage
