## Why This Exists

As a QUT student, I was tired of:
- Clicking through Gradescope 50+ times per assignment when trying to see if I met test cases
- Being forced to wait when I'm trying to get quick feedback on my work
- Losing focus switching between code editor and browser
- Manual file compression, uploads and form submissions

This tool automates the entire submission process so you can focus on coding, not clicking.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install qut-gradescope-autosubmitter && playwright install chromium
```
```bash
# One-time setup
gradescope init        # Create config file
gradescope credentials # Save QUT login

# Daily usage
gradescope submit      # Submit current assignment
```

That's it. No more manual submissions.


*Or use it with your existing repository as a [Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/qut-gradescope-autosubmission)* 😊

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **🔐 Authenticates with QUT SSO** - Handles university login automatically (using Playwright)
2. **🎯 Navigates to Gradescope** - Finds your course and assignment using smart matching
3. **📦 Bundles your files** - Creates submission zip (respects .gitignore)
4. **⬆️ Submits automatically** - Handles uploads and form submission
5. **📊 Shows your grade** - Displays results when available

Everything runs locally using browser automation. No data leaves your machine except for the normal submission to Gradescope.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **PyPI Release** - Available on PyPI
- ✅ **Stable Features** - Core submission functionality is reliable and tested

**Usage Responsibility:**
- This tool is provided "as-is" for legitimate academic use
- Users are responsible for complying with QUT academic integrity policies
- Avoid excessive submissions that may trigger rate limiting on QUT SSO
- Use session persistence (default) to minimize login requests

**Limitations:**
- Requires QUT SSO access and Gradescope course enrollment
- May break if QUT or Gradescope significantly change their interfaces
- Some specialized assignment types may not be supported

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- QUT student account with Gradescope access
- Internet connection for initial setup and submissions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
- **Login failures:** Use `gradescope credentials` to reconfigure
- **Assignment not found:** Check course code and assignment name in config matches Gradescope
- **Browser issues:** Run `gradescope doctor` for system diagnostics

For detailed troubleshooting, see the [Command Reference](CLI_REFERENCE.md) or run `gradescope --help`.
