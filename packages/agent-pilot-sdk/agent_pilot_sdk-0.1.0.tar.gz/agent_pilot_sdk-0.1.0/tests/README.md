# Pilot Probing Test Suite

This directory contains unit tests for the `agent_pilot` package. The tests have been implemented following pytest best practices, with an emphasis on reusable fixtures and comprehensive coverage.

## Test Files

- `conftest.py` - Contains common fixtures used across multiple test files
- `test_config.py` - Tests for the configuration module
- `test_consumer.py` - Tests for the event consumer functionality
- `test_context.py` - Tests for context management functionality
- `test_event_queue.py` - Tests for the event queue implementation
- `test_models.py` - Tests for Pydantic model definitions
- `test_monitor.py` - Tests for the monitoring functionality (track_event and wrap functions)
- `test_openai_utils.py` - Tests for OpenAI utility functions
- `test_parsers.py` - Tests for input/output parser functions
- `test_prompt.py` - Tests for template handling and rendering
- `test_utils.py` - Tests for utility functions
- `test_volcengine_utils.py` - Tests for Volcengine utility functions

## Coverage

The test suite aims to provide good coverage of the codebase with an emphasis on:

- Basic functionality of each module
- Edge cases and error handling
- Common usage patterns

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use:

```bash
pytest
```

For a coverage report, use:

```bash
pytest --cov=agent_pilot
```

## Areas for Further Improvement

While these tests provide good coverage, there are several areas that could be improved in future updates:

1. **Async Functions**: The async functions in `monitor.py` (`async_wrap`, `async_stream_handler`) need more comprehensive tests.

2. **Integration Tests**: The current tests focus on unit testing individual modules. Adding integration tests that verify the interaction between multiple components would be valuable.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - More tests for rare edge cases in error handling
   - Tests for concurrency issues in the threaded components

4. **Mock Optimization**: Some tests use extensive mocking which could potentially miss issues with the actual implementation. Consider adding tests with fewer mocks for critical paths.

5. **Performance Tests**: Add tests that verify performance characteristics for modules like `event_queue.py` and `consumer.py`.

6. **Parameterized Tests**: Some tests could be refactored to use pytest's parameterization for more concise test definitions.

## Test Fixtures

The test suite makes extensive use of fixtures defined in `conftest.py` to reduce code duplication and make tests more maintainable. Common fixtures include:

- Mock configurations
- Sample events
- Mock HTTP responses

## Test Design Principles

These tests follow several key principles:

1. **Independence**: Each test can run independently without relying on state from other tests.
2. **Clarity**: Test names and docstrings clearly describe what is being tested.
3. **Focused Scope**: Each test focuses on testing a specific function or behavior.
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover both the happy path and error cases.
5. **Maintainability**: Common setup code is extracted into fixtures for reuse.
