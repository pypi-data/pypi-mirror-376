# PyDashboard

PyDashboard is a modular, easily extensible terminal dashboard entirely built in Python using [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io),
a framework built by [Textualize.io](https://www.textualize.io/).

It's inspired to projects like [WTFutil](https://wtfutil.com) (from which borrows the configuration file structure) 
but brings to the table new essential features like [user plugins](advanced/plugins.md) and [remote connections](advanced/remote_connection.md).

This project is still in developement and may be missing many important modules, you are welcome to make your own
and submit them.

Jump to the [Installation](getting_started.md) section to start using PyDashboard now or explore the [Modules](modules/apcupsd.md)
section to discover available modules.
