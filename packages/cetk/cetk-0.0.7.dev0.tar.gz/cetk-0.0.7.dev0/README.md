## Installation
```
python3 -m venv --prompt cetk .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
```
Check that installation was successful and receive information on how to use the toolkit:
```
cetk -h
```

Before using the toolkit, initialize the template database by:
```
cetkmanage migrate
```

If you did not change the default path, this should create
`~/.config/eclair/eclair.gpkg`

New databases can now be created by copying the template database. This is easiest done using the cetk command:
```
cetk create /home/myuser/mydatabase.gpkg
```

To use a specific database, set environment variable "CETK_DATABASE_PATH".
```
export CETK_DATABASE_PATH="/home/myuser/mydatabase.gpkg"
```

For more verbose logging, set environment variable CETK_DEBUG=1:
```
export CETK_DEBUG=1
```
