"""LLM Context endpoint for managing uploaded documents, domain knowledge, and templates.
This module provides API endpoints for listing, uploading, and deleting context files (PDFs, images, Word documents),
adding and updating domain knowledge text, and listing/applying quick templates for common industries.
It supports file processing status, progress tracking, and domain knowledge configuration for LLM enhancement.

Endpoints:
    - GET /llm-context/files: List all uploaded context files with status.
    - POST /llm-context/files: Upload a new context file.
    - DELETE /llm-context/files/{id}: Delete a context file.
    - GET /llm-context/domain: Get current domain knowledge text.
    - POST /llm-context/domain: Update domain knowledge text.
    - GET /llm-context/templates: List available quick templates.
    - POST /llm-context/templates/apply: Apply a quick template to domain knowledge.

Returns:
    JSON responses with file details, processing status, domain knowledge, and template info.

Raises:
    HTTPException: For errors in context management.
