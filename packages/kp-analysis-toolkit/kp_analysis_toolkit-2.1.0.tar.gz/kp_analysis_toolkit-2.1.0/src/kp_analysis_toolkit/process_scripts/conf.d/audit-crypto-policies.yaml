    System-wide crypto policies are used differently for Debian-based and RPM-based systems.  Refer to the links below for support documentation for each:
        RPM-based: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening
        Debian-based: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man7/crypto-policies.7.html
    
    Importantly, it covers OpenSSH, OpenSSL, IPSec (LibreSWAN), DNSSec (Bind) and OpenJDK.
