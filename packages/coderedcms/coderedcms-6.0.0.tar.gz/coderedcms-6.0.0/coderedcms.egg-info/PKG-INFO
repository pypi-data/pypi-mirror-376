## What is Wagtail CRX?

CRX, formerly known as CodeRed CMS, provides a large set of enhancements and
pre-built components for Wagtail which are ready to use out-of-the box! This
saves development time and avoids "re-inventing the wheel" by providing features
commonly needed by websites:

* Streamfield blocks and page templates for Bootstrap 5: rows, columns, hero
  units, carousels, buttons, modals, cards, and more!

* Settings for adding logo, navigation, footer, and other common elements.

* Rich set of SEO tagging attributes on each page.

* Configurable Google Analytics and other tracking.

* Robust form builder including the ability for multi-step forms, conditional
  logic, customized confirmation emails, MailChimp integration, and more.

* Article pages for building blogs, news, etc.

* Calendar and event pages.

* Google Maps blocks, and store locator functionality.

* Dynamic classifier system, for creating filterable categories.

* Website search functionality, filterable by page type.

* Style your site using SASS/SCSS directly from Django, without the need for
  Node.js


## Quick start

1. Run `pip install coderedcms`

2. Run `coderedcms start mysite --sitename "My Company Inc." --domain www.example.com`

    *Note: `--sitename` and `--domain` are optional to pre-populate settings of your website.*

3. Enter the project `cd mysite/`

4. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the core models.

5. Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create the initial admin user.

6. Run `python manage.py runserver` to launch the development server, and go to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, or `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to log in with your admin account.

See the [documentation](https://docs.coderedcorp.com/wagtail-crx/) for next steps and customizing your new site.
