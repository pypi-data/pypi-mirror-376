    "# Airline Support Report\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes a large number of airline support tickets and produces a report summarizing the complaints. This notebook mirrors the [airline support tutorial](https://data-people-group.github.io/blogs/2025/01/13/docwrangler/#what-is-docwrangler) in DocWrangler / DocETL ([Shankar et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12189)), allowing for direct comparison between DocETL and Semlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing pipeline consists of two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ([map](../../api/#semlib.Session.map)) In one LLM call _per complaint_, extract the chief complaint and other information as structured data.\n",
    "- ([apply](../../api/#semlib.Session.apply)) In a single LLM call, process all the structured data and produce a report summarizing the complaints. In DocETL's terminology, this is a \"reduce\" operation. Semlib's [reduce](../../api/#semlib.Session.reduce) mirrors the `reduce` higher-order function in functional programming, which combines elements from a list two at a time. Semlib's [apply](../../api/#semlib.Session.apply) method processes data in a single LLM call.\n",

       "### Common Complaints summarized across all tickets:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Customer Service Issues**: \n",
       "   - Many complaints center on poor customer service experiences, including unhelpful staff, inaccessible customer support (long wait times), and lack of clear communication regarding flight cancellations or changes.\n",
       "   - High frustration level tickets often express feelings of being disregarded, misled, or treated poorly, while medium frustration tickets may highlight confusion or disappointment rather than outright anger.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Flight Cancellations and Delays**:\n",
       "   - A significant number of complaints relate to flight cancellations or delays and the inadequate responsiveness of airlines in addressing the situation. High frustration tickets emphasize the resulting inconveniences, such as missed connections and financial losses.\n",
       "   - Medium frustration tickets highlight general irritation with the situation without an extreme emotional reaction.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Pricing and Hidden Charges**: \n",
       "   - Numerous complaints address unexpected costs or fees that passengers encountered, such as higher charges for luggage and unanticipated pricing discrepancies.\n",
       "   - High frustration tickets denote a sense of being exploited or frustrated by the pricing policies, while medium frustration tickets express confusion or annoyance at the difficulty of navigating costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Baggage Issues**: \n",
       "   - Complaints about lost or damaged luggage are prevalent, with many expressing disbelief over the compensation or support available for such incidents. High frustration tickets articulate distress over valuable items lost or the impact on travel plans.\n",
       "   - Medium frustration tickets may relay concern without reaching the level of significant anxiety.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Tech Issues and Booking Complications**: \n",
       "   - Several complaints relate to technical problems during the booking process or confusion regarding ticket rules and regulations, particularly around connecting flights and baggage handling.\n",
       "   - High frustration tickets are marked by feelings of helplessness regarding procedural issues, while medium frustration tickets reveal confusion about technology but not an overwhelming sense of urgency.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Seating Assignments**: \n",
       "   - Problems with seating arrangements and failures to honor pre-allocated seats are reported frequently, often leading to significant frustrations when families are separated or downgraded.\n",
       "   - High frustration complaints typically involve outright anger over the perceived injustices, while medium-level frustration might indicate disappointment or uncertainty.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Frustration Levels:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **High Frustration Level**:\n",
       "  - Complaints are intense, often expressing a mixture of anger, betrayal, or a feeling of being wronged. The customers frequently demand action, compensation, or vocalize a firm decision to avoid using that airline again. There’s often a strong emotional reaction tied to personal losses or stressful situations.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Medium Frustration Level**:\n",
       "  - These complaints convey dissatisfaction but often include a more measured tone. Customers are frustrated but might be seeking advice, expressing confusion about policies, or sharing experiences without an extreme emotional response. They may still be disappointed or annoyed but less likely than high frustration customers to express outrage or threat of action.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Low Frustration Level**:\n",
       "  - Complaints at this level generally reflect positive remarks or minor issues. Customers express satisfaction with some aspects of service, appreciate efforts made by staff, or confirm that their experiences were generally acceptable, aside from small complaints or suggestions for improvement.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the overall complaints indicate major issues with customer service, flight management, and pricing policies, with the intensity of complaints varying significantly based on the frustration levels of the customers. High frustration tickets tend to express feelings of helplessness and betrayal, while medium frustration tickets reflect confusion and irritation without extreme emotional responses. Low frustration complaints were rare and often offered constructive feedback instead of outright complaints."
