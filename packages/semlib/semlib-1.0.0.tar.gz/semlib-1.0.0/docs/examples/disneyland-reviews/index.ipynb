    "- ([map](../../api/#semlib.Session.map)) Extract criticism from each review, using one LLM call per review.\n",
    "- (non-semantic filter) Filter out reviews that do not contain any complaints.\n",

    "### Combine criticism into a single summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have tens of thousands of individual complaints. We want to combine this into a single summary of criticism. One option is to dump all the complaints into a long-context LLM and ask it to produce a summary in one go; this could work, but some research has shown that LLMs can exhibit poor performance when processing such large amounts of data in a single shot (this is one motivation behind research works like DocETL ([Shankar et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12189)) and LOTUS ([Patel et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11418))).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use Semlib's [reduce](../../api/#semlib.Session.reduce) operator to process the data, which is analogous to the [reduce or fold higher-order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_%28higher-order_function%29) in functional programming. The reduce operator takes as an argument a template that explains how to combine an \"accumulator\" with a single item, and applies this template n times to process each item in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a performance optimization, if we implement an associative template, then we can pass `associative=True` to the call to Semlib's `reduce()`, and then rather than issue O(n) LLM calls serially, Semlib will arrange the computation in a tree structure, with depth O(log n), which has a huge impact on decreasing the latency of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For computations that are \"naturally\" associative (e.g., addition), this is straightforward; in our case, the individual items in our data to process (the leaf nodes in the reduction tree) are individual complaints, while internal nodes are summaries of complaints. To support this, we \"tag\" leaf nodes in the data with [Box](../../api/#semlib.Box), and write a template that behaves differently based on whether inputs are leaf nodes or internal nodes of the reduction tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of this particular task, merging individual complaints into a running summary, a single LLM prompt (regardless of whether it's handling two individual complaints, a complaint and a summary, or two summaries) would probably work fine, but for other more complex tasks, this complexity may be necessary, so this tutorial demonstrates how to do it."

      "    Review 76: We had a great time at Disneyland. It was nice to see Fantasmic after missing the last few times although we didn't have a great spot. We did our first trip 12 years ago and it's likely our last with the kids so it was special. We stayed off site but close enough to walk. Pros: It's Disney. Love Pirates, Indiana Jones, Space Mountain,etc. We got to see a little of Star Wars Land which looks pretty impressive. Cons: It was very crowded. The Castle was being refurbished . Not an issue for us, but if you had a 6 year old Princess lover it could be a problem. The current fireworks are not nearly as good as the old ones. Kind of odd for us.I think this is our 6th trip so we know the park very well and move around it all the time. Our kids had the app down to get quick time estimates. We found some times when ride times were low and were generally out of park mid afternoon but there early and late. We quickly found out it was best to hit rope drop a the park not on early hours to get in some quick rides.\n",

But it's quite organised that they have characters in different locations at particular times for autograph signing. Food is very expensive and there isn't enough choice for vegetarians considering people visit from all over the world. Overall, disney has a way to bring out the kid in everyone and we deffo made the most of our 6th trip\n",

The other piece of advice was with kids 2 days is required and if you want to sit down for lunch   do it by mid day latest!What a fantastic time we had\n",

We went on a November 2nd (Thursday) the park was not overly busy. Be aware: The line to search your bag is long and the line to enter took much longer than expected. It would be nice to see some updates. Many parts of the park appear dated. We met Snow White she had chipped nail polish. Just not what I expected. We loved the Royal Theater performances!!! All the actors were fabulous!!! Highly recommend it!Overall there were some cool things to experience, but no need to come back. We will go to Disney World's Magic Kingdom from now on. \n",
