GNU Health HIS: The Libre Hospital Information System
=====================================================
 
Welcome to the Hospital Information System (HIS) of GNU Health!

The main areas of the HIS are:

* **Demographics and Community**: Individuals, domiciliary
  units, families, socioeconomics, demographic & administrative information
* **Patient Management**: Health encounters and evaluations,
  hospitalizations, clinical history and other information that makes up the
  electronic medical records (EMR)
* **Health Center**: Finances & billing, stock &
  pharmacy, staff, suppliers, beds, operating rooms and other relevant tasks
  to manage the health center
* **Laboratory and Medical Imaging**: Management of complementary orders such as
  lab tests, medical and diagnostic imaging requests and workflows
* **Health Information System**: Statistics, analytical reporting on collected
  data from the community and participating health institutions, e.g. demographics
  and epidemiology

Functionalities of specific modules are briefly summarized over here:

https://docs.gnuhealth.org/his/features.html#packages

The GH HIS is part of the GNU Health project, the **Libre digital health ecosystem**.

The GNU Health project combines the daily medical practice with state-of-the-art 
technology in bioinformatics and genetics. It provides a holistic approach 
to the  person, from the biological and molecular basis of disease to 
the social and environmental determinants of health.

This component is ready to integrate in the **GNU Health Federation**, which
allows to interconnect heterogeneous nodes and build large federated health 
networks across a region, province or country.
