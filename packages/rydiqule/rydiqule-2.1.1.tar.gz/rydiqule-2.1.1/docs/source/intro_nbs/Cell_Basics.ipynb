    "# Introduction to `Cell` and Real Atoms\n",
    "The graph-based framework that `rydiqule` is based on is incredibly flexible, but often flexibilty is not as useful as being able to perform common actions quickly. For example, the `Sensor` module of `rydiqule` allows for any value of any parameter to be supported. While this is great for flexibility, if you know the first two states of an atomic system are all `m_j` fine structrue states for the D2 line of Rubidium-87, it would be somewhat painful to manually specify the dipole moment and transition frequencies for every possible state pairing for the laser coupling the the two manifolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Cell` module of `rydiqule` is designed to address exactly this issue. It builds upon `Sensor` with additional functionality to automatically add quantities like quantum numbers, dipole moments, state energies, and decoherence rates. Indeed, if you are familiar with object-oriented programming in python, `Cell` in fact inherits `Sensor` as a subclass, meaning it has access to all the same methods, and has the same internal underlying structure. Importantly, `Cell` is *specifically* designed to model alkali atoms supported by the [Alkali Rydberg Calculator](https://arc-alkali-rydberg-calculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alkali_atom_data.html) project.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook will go over some of the basic ways to use `Cell` to solve real systems quickly and easily. This tutorial assumes you have gone through and understand the basics laid out in the `Introduction_To_Rydiqule` notebook. If any of the terminolgy in this notebook is unfamiliar, revisit that notebook for a demonstration of basic principles. This notebook will not revisit those basic priciples, it will primarily highlight the differences between `Cell` and `Sensor`.\n",

While we do have some [physics documentation](https://rydiqule.readthedocs.io/page/writeups/writeups_index.html), `rydiqule` is aimed primarily at physicists who already understand many of these concepts, and the docs are more for our implementation of the underlying physics.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you remember in `Sensor`, the states could be integers, strings, or tuples. `Cell` is a little bit more restrictive about what you can use for states. To describe states in `Cell`, `rydiqule` has introduced a new type using `python`'s `namedtuple` called `A_QState`, short for atomic quantum state. Note that this is a subclass of `tuple`, so no rules have changed; using this is a special case of the bases that can be defined in `Sensor`. This named tuple has 3 mandatory arguments, `n`, `l`, and `j` representing the first 3 quantum number of a rydberg quantum state. Additionally, there are 3 more optional arguments for `m_j`, `f`, and `m_f`. As you might expect, you cannot specify  `f` or `m_f` if `m_j` is specified, or vice versa. Also, to specify `m_f`, `f` must also be specified. All the usual quantum number rules for rydberg atoms must be obeyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access an `A_QState` directly as `rq.A_QState`, but it can be easier to `from rydiqule import A_QState` to shorten, since you may need to call it often. Let's start with a simple ground and excited state for the D1 line of Rubidium-85 just to see how the `Cell` constructor works. As a minimum, we need to specify a atom with a string, and pass a list of `A_QState`s. "

Like basically everything else in `rydiqule`, these quantities are expressed in Mrad/s. In addition to data on the nodes (which is just for reference and does not affect solving directly), there is a decoherent transition added from the second state to the first, associated with natural state lifetime of the $5P_{1/2}$ state before it decays back to the ground state. In general, `rydiqule` will add natural transition rates from higher to lower states. There are some caveats and details to how this is done that will be discussed later in this section. Just for fun, let's demonstrate that even without anything else explicitly defined, we already have a `decoherence_matrix`."

    "#### List shorthand\n",
    "While it is nice that we can define all of these states with `A_QState`, it is easy to imagine a situation in which there are a lot more states in a system of interest that you want to write down (consider all possible hyperfine sublevels in a high angular momentum upper rydberg state). You could be defining the states for hours. As you might imagine, `rydiqule` has a built-in way to define all of these states at once. When we define our `A_QState`, we can define any of the quantum numbers from `j` onwards (so `m_j`, `f`, `m_f`) as a list, expanding the single specification out into a list of states automatically. Below we show this shorthand to add both the D1 and D2 excited states with one `A_QState` specification. This functionality is identical to using `tuple` states in a `Sensor`, and indeed is the motivation for adding the functionality in the first place."

While the basic mechanics of how decoherence is handled in `Cell` is identical to `Sensor`, there are some differences in what get added to the `couplings` graph that need to be accounted for. In this section we discuss the details of decoherent couplings in the `Cell` class, including what is calculated automatically, what isn't, and how to make it consistent with calculations and experiments outside of `rydiqule`."

    "You may notice in the above examples that `gamma_mismatch` is always sent to ground automatically. It is often suffient to assume this since in many systems population will eventually end up back in the ground state regardless of what path it took. Still this is not always the case, so how de we control this behavior? `rydiqule` has a couple of options that we control using the `gamma_mismatch` option in the constructor:\n",
    "1. `\"ground\"`, the option demonstrated above, is the default. It adds a decoherent coupling from each state to $nS^{1/2}$, where n is the principle quantum number of the atom specified in the cell. If more that one sublevel exists for this state in the `Cell`, the decoherence will be divided equally amongst all sublevels. This coupling will be added regardless of whether the transition is dipole-allowed, since it is based on the assumption that all population will *eventually* decay to ground through some pathway. This option should be avoided for systems containing dark states.\n",
    "2. `\"all\"` is an option that divides the mismatching decay values between all other calculated decay paths. The fraction of `gamma_mismatch` added to each edge is weighted by the existing calculated natural transition rates. So if state $|3\\rangle$ has dipole-allowed decays to states $|2\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ of 6 and 4 respectively, and a total `gamma_lifetime` in state $|3\\rangle$ of 15, a `gamma_mismatch` of 3 and 2 will be added to the `(3,2)` and `(3,1)` edges respectively. Note that there must be a dipole-allowed decay for every state in the `Cell` other than the ground state or else selecting this option will error.\n",
    "3. `\"none\"` does exactly what it sounds like: it will not add a single decay to the system for the computed state lifetime and decay rate mismatch. In this case, it is typically assumed that you will add a decay manually, but this leaves acounting for decay up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, `rydiqule` might support other options for which there is a compelling use case, but for now, anything besides the `ground` and `all` as described above will require manual specification of decays using the `none` option."

    "### 3.3 Alternate specifications of `rabi_frequency`\n",
    "Since `Cell` tries to support an interface to atomic physics that is a more close to real-life experiments, it has a couple of ways to speciy the power of a field beyond the `rabi_frequency` that is used in `Sensor`. As we have already demonstrated, you can define the rabi frequency of a coupling just fine (a `Cell` is just a `Sensor` after all), but `Cell` does also introduce a couple more options. All totalled, the three options for `rabi_frequency` specification are as follows:\n",
    "1. Base specification of `rabi_frequency` just as in `Sensor`.\n",
    "2. Specification of electric field, in V/m via the the `e_field` arguments. `rydiqule` will calculate the rabi_frequency based on the computed dipole moment.\n",
    "3. Specification of both beam power, in watts and $\\frac{1}{e^2}$ beam waist (radius) in meters via the `beam_power` and `beam_waist` arguments.\n",
    "In all cases, the arguments are provided as optional keyword arguments to the `add_coupling` function. These options are mutually exclusive. Also, none of this information will be stored on the graph directly - it will be converted to `rabi_frequency`, which is the only such quantity that is stored on the graph. We briefly demonstrate all of this below by defining a simple 3-level vee scheme."

    "### 3.4 Clebsch-Gordon coefficients\n",
    "When defining couplings over manifolds, it is important to consider the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients (which we will refer to as CGC), which define the relating weighting of dipole moments between different sublevels. Recall that in `Sensor`, this is handled using the `coherent_cc` optional keyword argument in `add_coupling`. In `Cell`, the `coherent_cc` is filled in automatically using [ARC's functions](https://arc-alkali-rydberg-calculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/arc.alkali_atom_functions.AlkaliAtom.getSphericalDipoleMatrixElement.html#arc.alkali_atom_functions.AlkaliAtom.getSphericalDipoleMatrixElement) for the spherical component of the dipole matrix element. This section is really only intended to demonstrate that `coherent_cc` is calculated automatically in cell. For a more detailed description of how `rydiqule` handles coupling between manifolds of states, check the [physics documentation](https://rydiqule.readthedocs.io/page/writeups/writeups_index.html). Here we just create a simple `Cell` on the D1 transition with fine structure splitting, and show that `coherent_cc` is populated on the graph even if we don't specify it explicitly."

    "Recall that when we want to define a system with doppler broadening in a `Sensor`, we define the `vP` parameter either in the constructor or by accessing the attribute directly after construction, and then specifying the `kvec` parameter in couplings. In a `Cell`, however, the magnitude of the `kvec` parameter is fixed by the transition frequency, and the most probable speed is already set by the temperature. So when adding a coupling with doppler broadening in a `Cell`, we set only the newly-introduced `kunit` when couplings are defined. This is a tuple representing an `(x, y, z)` unit vector representing the direction of the plane wave of the field. Other than that, solving with doppler broadening in a `Cell` is identical to doing so in `Sensor`, and we can otherwise do everything the same way.\n",
