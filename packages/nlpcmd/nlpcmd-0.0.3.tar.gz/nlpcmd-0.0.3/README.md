# nlpcmd

Type `nlpcmd` in your terminal to start an interactive prompt, or run `nlpcmd what is my ip` to execute a single natural-language command.

Examples:
- `nlpcmd what is my ip`
- `nlpcmd show my ip`
- `nlpcmd who am i`
- `nlpcmd say hello to avik`
- `nlpcmd ping example.com`

Extend by editing `nlpcmd/engine.py` (intent patterns) and `nlpcmd/actions.py` (action implementations).
