**SuperTable — The simplest data warehouse & cataloging system.**  
A high‑performance, lightweight transaction catalog that integrates multiple
basic tables into a single, cohesive framework designed for ultimate
efficiency.
It automatically creates and manages tables so you can start running SQL queries
immediately—no complicated schemas or manual joins required.


---

## Installation

```bash
pip install supertable
```

## Setup
To set the SUPERTABLE_HOME variable in Linux (default: ~/supertable):
```bash
export SUPERTABLE_HOME="$HOME/supertable"
```

SuperTable is published on PyPI. The only requirement is Python ≥ 3.10.

---

## Key Features

- **Automatic table creation**  
  Load your data and SuperTable instantly builds the required tables and
  columns—no predefined schema or extra setup.

- **Self‑referencing architecture**  
  Combine and analyze data across tables without writing manual joins.

- **Staging module with history**  
  Upload files to a staging area and reload any version at any time, keeping a
  complete audit trail for tracking and compliance.

- **Columnar storage for speed**  
  With fully denormalized columnar storage, queries remain lightning-fast, 
  even when dealing with thousands of columns

- **Built‑in RBAC security**  
  Define users and roles to control row‑ and column‑level access—no external
  security tools required.

- **Platform independent**  
  Deploy on any major cloud provider or on‑premise. SuperTable is a pure Python
  library with no hidden costs.

---

## Examples

The project ships with an **`examples/`** folder that walks you through common
workflows:

| Script prefix | What it shows |
|---------------|---------------|
| **1.\*** | Create a SuperTable, roles, and users |
| **2.\*** | Write dummy or single‑file data into a simple table |
| **3.\*** | Read data, query statistics, and inspect metadata |
| **4.1**   | Clean obsolete files |
| **5.\*** | Delete tables and supertables |

Additional utility scripts demonstrate locking, parallel writes, and
performance measurement. Browse the folder to get started quickly.

## Benefits

- **Quick start**  
  Go from raw data to query‑ready in minutes—faster than spreadsheets or
  traditional databases.

- **Higher efficiency**  
  Eliminate manual steps and rework so you spend more time analyzing and less
  time wrangling.

- **Holistic insights**  
  Analyze datasets individually or together to uncover trends, outliers, and
  cross‑dependencies.

- **Cost savings**  
  Consolidate licenses, simplify support, and reinvest the savings in deeper
  analytics.

SuperTable provides a flexible, high‑performance solution that grows with your
business. Cut complexity, save time, and gain deeper insights—all in a single,
streamlined platform.
