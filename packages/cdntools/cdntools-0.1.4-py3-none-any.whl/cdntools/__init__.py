"""cdntools

Tools for modeling competitive protein dimerization networks:
 - ReactionSys: JSON-driven reaction system representation
 - MonoSolve / DimerSolve: steady state concentration solvers
 - PnD_ODE_solve / PnD_ODE_plot: time-course simulation utilities
 - RandomNet / GraphCircularPlot / RandomReactionSys: random system generation & visualization

Public API is curated via __all__ for clean star-imports.
