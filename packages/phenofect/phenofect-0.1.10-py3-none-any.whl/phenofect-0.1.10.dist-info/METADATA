# PhenoFECT: Phenology Forecaster and Explorer under Climate Change

## What is PhenoFECT?

PhenoFECT is Python package designed to guide the overall analysis procedure for **Budding & Flowering Prediction** specially tailored to **user-target plant**. It offers useful functions including, **Key Parameter Examination of temperature-based model, Clustering, Visualization, Downloading & Merging Phenological and Meteorological Data**... and so on. The Chill-Day model refined by this package demonstrates the higest prediction accuracy for Korean local areas among previously published models. Additionally, PhenoFECT has a broder objective: to become a generalized, open source tool for **accurate prediction of plant phenology** and to provide **scientific insights on phenology shift** in many regions affected by climate change.

## How to use PhenoFECT?

[Here](https://wikidocs.net/book/17034) is the detailed user guide of PhenoFECT.  

## Main Features

PhenoFECT is designed to specialize in these areas.
- Contains sufficient [Embedded Data](#description-for-embedded-dataset) extracted from [**Public Data Portal in Korea**](https://www.data.go.kr/). 
- Easily [download and merge](https://wikidocs.net/272158) various types of phenological and meteorological data into the embedded data set or create your own. [Filter and Preprocess]([https://wikidocs.net/272158](https://wikidocs.net/272259)) data to make it compatible with the package.
- [Predict Bud-burst](https://wikidocs.net/272309) and [Predict Flowering](https://wikidocs.net/272326) simultaneously for multiple regions with Chill-Day Model and Dataset. Highest accuracy for Korean local areas among previously published models.
- Simple application of [Hierarchical Clustering](https://wikidocs.net/272554) based on Chill-Day Model Temperature Time and [2D & 3D t-SNE method](https://wikidocs.net/272554) for future analysis.
- Select best key parameter sets with [Error Heatmap](https://wikidocs.net/272326#details-of-flowering_error_heatmap) and [Error Contourmap](https://wikidocs.net/272326#details-of-flowering_error_contourmap) visualization based on Mean Absolute Error(MAE) & Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE).
- After select the best fit parameter set, [line_graph & simple regression](https://wikidocs.net/272345) shows how you select parameters well.
- [Detailed shape of Chill-Day Model graph](https://wikidocs.net/272553#details-of-detailed_chillday_graph) for each location & year and [Merged Chill-Day Model graph](https://wikidocs.net/272750#details-of-chillday_graph_merged) for each Cluster. 
- Contains [information](https://wikidocs.net/272757) about the years of occurrence of El Niño and La Niña in Korea, gives plot [how the prediction error shifts](https://wikidocs.net/272750#prediction-error-shift-under-climate-change) under climate change.

All embedded dataset can be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/CSBL-urap/2024-summer-swkim/tree/main/Embedded_Dataset) or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C1-MjZfz-xxKi8u51Na7rhOPy-hr4DrV). The `daily_meteorological_data` is not in repository's `Embedded_Dataset Folder` due to its capacity.  

## Physiological Background for Plant Phenology

After summer, if the nutrition & weather conditions are satisfied, woody plants prepare next year flowering by differentiation to **flower buds**. But to prevent flower bud differentiate to flowers in cold winter condition because of transient warm temperature, flower buds come into **dormancy state** and their flowering control genes maintain bud statement until they get enough cold requirment. 

![Endo-dormancy (Cherry Blossom)](https://github.com/CSBL-urap/2024-summer-swkim/blob/main/Imgs/cherry_endo_dormancy.jpg)

In the Phenology Model, we call the cold requirement as '*Chill-requirement(Cr)*'. If the woody plant get enough cold, dormancy releases. From this time, plant needs Heat to differentiate into flowers. After the heat accumulated same amount to Cr, the Budding event happens. We call that as **Bud burst**. Last, the amount of heat accumulation flower bud differentiate into flower, **flowering**, is called as '*Heat-requirement(Hr)*'.

![Flowering (Cherry Blossom)](https://github.com/CSBL-urap/2024-summer-swkim/blob/main/Imgs/cherry_flowering.jpg)

- Dormancy initiation: The Day when minimum temperature reaches to 5-7℃. (Depends on species)
- Dormancy release: The first Day when Chill accumulation is lower than Chill-requirement. 
- Bud burst: Observed Day when 20% of total flower buds in Woody plant get into bud burst.
- Flowering: Observed Day when 3 flowers are observed in a branch. 
- Detailed definition and observation rules are [**guidelines**](https://data.kma.go.kr/data/publication/publicationGlList.do) of KMA(Korea Meteorological Administration).
