## Typing stubs for pika

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`pika`](https://github.com/pika/pika) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `pika`. This version of
`types-pika-ts` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`pika==1.3.*`.

The `types-pika` package contains alternate, more complete type stubs, that are maintained outside of typeshed.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/pika`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pika)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.18.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.405

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`4b0623f4fb2c4e5a04a0244e1592b1481a26e47e`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/4b0623f4fb2c4e5a04a0244e1592b1481a26e47e).
