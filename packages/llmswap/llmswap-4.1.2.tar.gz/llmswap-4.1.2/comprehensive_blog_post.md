# Beyond GitHub Copilot: How I Built a Free, Multi-Provider Code Generation CLI

*September 9, 2025 | By Sreenath Menon*

As a developer with 13+ years of experience, I've watched the evolution of AI-powered development tools with great interest. When GitHub Copilot CLI was announced, I was impressed by the concept but frustrated by the limitations and subscription costs. That frustration led me to build something better: **llmswap** - a free, open-source code generation CLI that works with any AI provider.

## The Problem: Limited Choice and Subscription Fatigue

While GitHub Copilot now supports multiple models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro), you're still locked into their subscription model and limited to their provider selection. What if you want to use IBM Watson for enterprise scenarios, Groq for ultra-fast inference, or run everything locally with Ollama? What if you're already paying for multiple AI services and don't want another $10/month subscription?

That's where llmswap shines. One tool, eight providers, zero subscription costs, complete freedom.

## Two Powerful Ways to Generate Code

llmswap offers two distinct workflows that transform how you interact with AI for code generation:

### 1. Terminal-First Development

The `llmswap generate` command brings natural language code generation directly to your terminal:

```bash
llmswap generate "sort files by size in reverse order"
```
**Response:**
```bash
du -sh * | sort -hr
```

```bash
llmswap generate "Python function to read JSON with error handling" --language python
```
**Response:**
```python
import json

def read_json_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            data = json.load(file)
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found.")
        return None
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON format - {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        return None
```

The magic happens in the details:
- **Project awareness**: Detects Node.js, Python, Rust, or Java projects and tailors responses
- **Language targeting**: `--language` flag ensures you get the right syntax
- **Safe execution**: `--execute` flag asks before running generated commands
- **File output**: `--save` flag writes code directly to files with proper permissions

### 2. Vim Integration: The Game Changer

Here's where llmswap truly excels. Vim integration transforms your editor into an AI-powered code generation environment:

```vim
:r !llmswap generate "Express.js middleware for rate limiting"
```
**Inserts directly into your buffer:**
```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const createRateLimiter = (options = {}) => {
  return rateLimit({
    windowMs: options.windowMs || 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: options.maxRequests || 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    message: options.message || {
      error: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
    },
    standardHeaders: true,
    legacyHeaders: false,
  });
};

module.exports = createRateLimiter;
```

## Real-World Usage Patterns That Save Hours Daily

```
**Response:**
```sql
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count
FROM users 
GROUP BY email 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Git Operations

```bash
llmswap generate "git command to squash last 3 commits"
```
**Response:**
```bash

```
**Inserts:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

**Database Schema Generation:**
```vim
:r !llmswap generate "MongoDB schema for e-commerce product with variants"
```
**Inserts:**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const variantSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  sku: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  size: String,
  color: String,
  material: String,
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
  inventory: { type: Number, default: 0 },
  images: [String]
});

const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  description: String,
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  brand: String,
  basePrice: { type: Number, required: true },
  variants: [variantSchema],
  tags: [String],
  isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  updatedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);
```

## Beyond Basic Generation: Advanced Features

### Cloud Operations
```bash
llmswap generate "AWS CLI command to list all EC2 instances with their tags"

aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0]]' --output table
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
llmswap generate "awk command to extract IP addresses from nginx access log"
```
**Response:**
```bash
awk '{print $1}' /var/log/nginx/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### API Testing
```bash
llmswap generate "curl command to test REST API with POST data and headers" --language bash
```
**Response:**
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-here" \
  -d '{
    "name": "test",
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }' \
  https://api.example.com/users
```

## The Technical Architecture That Makes It Possible

llmswap achieves this flexibility through:

**Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, IBM Watson, Cohere, Perplexity, and Ollama
**Smart Context Detection**: Automatically detects your project type and tailors responses
**Unified Interface**: Same commands work across all providers
**Zero Configuration**: Auto-detects available API keys from environment variables

## Installation and Setup

Getting started is incredibly simple:

```bash
pip install llmswap
```

Then set up your preferred provider (you only need one to get started):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."       # For Claude
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."          # For GPT-4
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."             # For Google Gemini
export WATSONX_API_KEY="..."            # For IBM watsonx
export WATSONX_PROJECT_ID="..."         # watsonx project
export GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."           # For Groq ultra-fast inference
export COHERE_API_KEY="co_..."          # For Cohere Command models
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="pplx-..."    # For Perplexity web search
```

That's it. No subscription needed, no vendor lock-in, no complex configuration.

## The Economics: Why This Matters

GitHub Copilot costs $10/month per developer. For a team of 10, that's $1,200/year just for code suggestions. With llmswap:

- **Use any provider**: Switch to cheaper alternatives like Gemini (96% cost reduction)
- **Local options**: Run Ollama locally for completely free usage
- **Pay as you go**: Only pay for what you use across providers
- **Provider flexibility**: Already have Claude API access? Use that instead of paying for another subscription

## Real Developer Workflows

**Morning DevOps routine:**
```bash
llmswap generate "show disk usage sorted by size"
# Output: du -sh * | sort -hr
llmswap generate "restart nginx and check status"
# Output: sudo systemctl restart nginx && sudo systemctl status nginx
```

**Debugging session in vim:**
```vim
:r !llmswap generate "JavaScript function to debounce API calls"
:r !llmswap generate "error handling wrapper for async functions"
```

**Database migration:**
```bash
llmswap generate "PostgreSQL alter table to add index on email column"
# Output: ALTER TABLE users ADD INDEX idx_email (email);
```

## The Future of Development Tools

What excites me most about llmswap isn't just the immediate productivity gainsâ€”it's the principle. Developers deserve choice. We shouldn't be locked into single vendors or forced into subscriptions for basic AI functionality.

The response from the community has been overwhelming. Within weeks of launch, we've seen thousands of downloads and developers sharing their own creative workflows.

## Try It Today

Whether you're a vim enthusiast, terminal power user, or just someone who wants more choice in AI tools, llmswap offers something unique: true freedom in AI-powered development.

```bash
pip install llmswap
llmswap generate "your first command here"
```

The future of coding assistance is multi-provider, open-source, and in your control. Welcome to that future.
