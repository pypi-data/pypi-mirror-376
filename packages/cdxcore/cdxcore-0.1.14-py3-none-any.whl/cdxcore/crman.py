r"""
Overview
--------

A very simple implementation of a tool that tracks the last printed line before a newline was encountered.
Helps with somewhat consistent progress reporting with "\\r" and "\\n" characters.

*This functionality does not quite work accross all terminal types which were tested. Main focus is to make
it work for Jupyer for now. Any feedback on
how to make this more generically operational is welcome.

Used by :class:`cdxcore.verbose.Context`.

Import

"""

from collections.abc import Callable

class CRMan(object):
    r"""
    Carriage Return ("\\r") manager.    
    
    This class is meant to enable efficient per-line updates using "\\r" for text output with a focus on making it work with both Jupyter and the command shell.
    In particular, Jupyter does not support the ANSI `\\33[2K` 'clear line' code. To simulate clearing
    lines, ``CRMan`` keeps track of the length of the current line, and clears it by appending spaces to a message
    following "\\r"
    accordingly.

        Convert `message` containing "\\r" and "\\n" into a printable string which ensures
