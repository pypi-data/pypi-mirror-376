"""Torchrec Model Tracker

The model tracker module provides functionality to track and retrieve unique IDs and 
embeddings for supported modules during training. This is useful for identifying and 
retrieving the latest delta or unique rows for a model, which can help compute topk 
or to stream updated embeddings from predictors to trainers during online training.

Key features include:
- Tracking unique IDs and embeddings for supported modules
- Support for multiple consumers with independent tracking
- Configurable tracking modes (ID_ONLY, EMBEDDING)
- Compaction of tracked data to reduce memory usage
