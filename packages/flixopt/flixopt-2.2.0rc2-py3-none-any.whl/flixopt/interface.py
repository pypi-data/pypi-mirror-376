class PiecewiseConversion(Interface):
    """Define piecewise linear conversion relationships between multiple flows.

    This class models complex conversion processes where the relationship between
    input and output flows changes at different operating points, such as:

    - Variable efficiency equipment (heat pumps, engines, turbines)
    - Multi-stage chemical processes with different conversion rates
    - Equipment with discrete operating modes
    - Systems with capacity constraints and thresholds

    Args:
        piecewises: Dictionary mapping flow labels to their Piecewise conversion functions.
            Keys are flow names (e.g., 'electricity_in', 'heat_out', 'fuel_consumed').
            Values are Piecewise objects defining conversion factors at different operating points.
            All Piecewise objects must have the same number of pieces and compatible domains
            to ensure consistent conversion relationships across operating ranges.

    Note:
        Special modeling features:

        - **Gaps**: Express forbidden operating ranges by creating non-contiguous pieces.
          Example: `[(0,50), (100,200)]` - cannot operate between 50-100 units
        - **Points**: Express discrete operating points using pieces with identical start/end.
          Example: `[(50,50), (100,100)]` - can only operate at exactly 50 or 100 units

    Examples:
        Heat pump with variable COP (Coefficient of Performance):

        - Compressors/pumps: Power consumption vs flow rate
        - Multi-stage processes: Different conversion rates per stage
        - Equipment with minimum loads: Cannot operate below threshold
        - Batch processes: Discrete production campaigns

class PiecewiseEffectsPerFlowHour(Interface):
    """
    Define piecewise linear relationships between flow rate and various effects (costs, emissions, etc.).

    This class models situations where the relationship between flow rate and effects changes at
    different flow rate levels, such as:
    - Pump efficiency curves across operating ranges
    - Emission factors that vary with operating levels
    - Capacity-dependent transportation costs
    - Decision between different operating modes or suppliers
    - Optional equipment activation with minimum flow requirements

    Args:
        piecewise_flow_rate: `Piecewise` defining the valid flow rate segments.
            Each Piece represents a linear segment with (min_flow, max_flow) bounds.

        piecewise_shares: Dictionary mapping effect names to their `Piecewise`.
            Keys are effect names (e.g., 'Costs', 'CO2', 'Maintenance').
            Values are `Piecewise` objects defining the absolute effect values (not rates/prices).

            ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Values represent total effect amounts, not unit rates.
            For a flow rate of X, the effect value is interpolated from the `Piecewise`.
            This is NOT flow_rate × unit_price (which would be non-linear).

    Behavior:
        - If the first piece doesn't start at zero, flow rate is automatically bounded
          by piecewise_flow_rate (when OnOffParameters are not used)
        - Each segment represents a linear relationship within that flow rate range
        - Effects are interpolated linearly within each piece
        - All `Piece`s of the different `Piecewise`s at index i are active at the same time
        - A decision whether to utilize the effect can be modeled by defining multiple Pieces for the same flow rate range
