	abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

	abstract = {Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing, requiring quantum error correction for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected ``logical'' qubits, where information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy, poses significant challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Utilizing logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral atom arrays, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities, arbitrary connectivity, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout. Operating this logical processor with various types of encodings, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface code distance from d=3 to d=7, preparation of color code qubits with break-even fidelities, fault-tolerant creation of logical GHZ states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 color code qubits. Finally, using three-dimensional [[8,3,2]] code blocks, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path toward large-scale logical processors.},

	abstract = {The neutral atom array has gained prominence in quantum computing for its scalability and operation fidelity. Previous works focus on fixed atom arrays (FAAs) that require extensive SWAP operations for long-range interactions. This work explores a novel architecture reconfigurable atom arrays (RAAs), also known as field programmable qubit arrays (FPQAs), which allows for coherent atom movements during circuit execution under some constraints. Such atom movements, which are unique to this architecture, could reduce the cost of long-range interactions significantly if the atom movements could be scheduled strategically. In this work, we introduce Atomique, a compilation framework designed for qubit mapping, atom movement, and gate scheduling for RAA. Atomique contains a qubit-array mapper to decide the coarse-grained mapping of the qubits to arrays, leveraging MAX k-Cut on a constructed gate frequency graph to minimize SWAP overhead. Subsequently, a qubit-atom mapper determines the fine-grained mapping of qubits to specific atoms in the array and considers load balance to prevent hardware constraint violations. We further propose a router that identifies parallel gates, schedules them simultaneously, and reduces depth. We evaluate Atomique across 20+ diverse benchmarks, including generic circuits (arbitrary, QASMBench, SupermarQ), quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits. Atomique consistently outperforms IBM Superconducting, FAA with long-range gates, and FAA with rectangular and triangular topologies, achieving significant reductions in depth and the number of two-qubit gates.},
