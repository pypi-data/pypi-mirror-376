# Weaviate ORM
### A Pythonic ORM-style layer for Weaviate

`weaviate-orm` provides a structured, object-oriented interface to the Weaviate vector database. Inspired by traditional ORM patterns, it allows you to define collections as Python classes, automatically generate Weaviate schemas, and perform CRUD and similarity-based queries without leaving the object-oriented paradigm.

## Features

- **Declarative Schema Definition**  
  Define collections using Python classes and descriptors for properties and cross-references.

- **Dynamic Schema Generation via Metaclass**  
  A metaclass extracts property and reference definitions to auto-generate Weaviate-compatible schema structures.

- **Object-Oriented CRUD Operations**  
  Seamlessly create, retrieve, update, and delete data using instance methods â€” no raw queries needed.

- **Recursive Save & Update**  
  Handles deeply nested references and automatically saves or updates related objects when desired.

- **Flexible Engine Binding**  
  The engine takes any connection method from the `weaviate` library, allowing support for local, remote, or custom configurations.

- **UUID Management**  
  Built-in support for both `uuid4` and `uuid5` strategies â€” including UUID validation and immutability enforcement.

- **Optional Auto-loading of References**  
  Cross-references can be automatically resolved into full model instances when accessed.

- **Support for Near-Vector and Near-Text Queries**  
  Leverage Weaviateâ€™s native similarity search APIs directly from your model classes.

- **Strict Typing and Validation**  
  Type enforcement and optional validation logic on properties and references using Python descriptors.

- **Fully Tested**  
  Includes both unit and integration tests with Pytest and Docker-based Weaviate setups.

## Design Patterns

- **Descriptor Pattern**  
  Custom `Property` and `Reference` descriptors manage validation, casting, and schema representation of scalar and relational fields.

- **Metaclass-Based Schema Introspection**  
  A metaclass (`Weaviate_Meta`) dynamically collects all descriptors from a class and builds the full Weaviate schema. It also generates a dynamic `__init__` constructor based on the field signatures.

- **Engine Abstraction Layer**  
  The `Weaviate_Engine` encapsulates connection logic and schema management. It supports any connection method compatible with the `weaviate` Python client (e.g., local, remote, or cloud).

- **Instance-Oriented CRUD**  
  CRUD operations (including recursive reference handling and UUID safety checks) are exposed as instance methods on models that inherit from `Base_Model`.

- **Reference Resolution Strategy**  
  `Reference` descriptors can be configured to auto-load full objects (not just UUIDs), and support both one-way and two-way references, as well as single or list cardinalities.

## Installation

You can install `weaviate_orm` either from PyPI (once published) or directly from the source repository.

### ðŸ“¦ From PyPI (recommended)
```bash
pip install weaviate-orm
```

### ðŸ›  From Git (development and testing)
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.opencode.de/bbsr_ida_public/weaviate_orm.git
cd weaviate_orm
pip install -e .
```
Note: Make sure your Python environment includes the required Weaviate client:

```bash
pip install weaviate-client
```

## Quick Start
In this example, we will use a local Weaviate instance using text2vec_ollama as the default vectorizer with a local ollama instance running and providing "snowflake-arctic-embed2" as embedding model.

### Create a Model
Create two related models `Paper` and `Author` and specify configuration for the weaviate schema. 

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import os
from uuid import UUID, uuid5
import datetime

from weaviate_orm.weaviate_base import Base_Model
from weaviate_orm.weaviate_property import Property
from weaviate_orm.weavitae_reference import Reference, Reference_Type

from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType

# Get the host and port from environment variables
llm_host = os.getenv("LLM_HOST", "llm")
llm_port = int(os.getenv("LLM_PORT", 11434))

class Paper(Base_Model):
    vector_config = Configure.Vectors.text2vec_ollama(
            api_endpoint = f"http://{llm_host}:{llm_port}", #api-endpoint for the local ollama model
            model = "snowflake-arctic-embed2", #Embedding model to use
            vectorize_collection_name = False
        )
    
    title = Property(cast_type=str, description="The title of the paper", required=True, weaviate_type=DataType.TEXT, vectorize_property_name=True)
    abstract = Property(cast_type=str, description="The abstract of the paper", required=True, weaviate_type=DataType.TEXT, vectorize_property_name=True)
    pub_date = Property(cast_type=datetime.date, description="The publication date of the paper", required=True, weaviate_type=DataType.DATE, skip_vectorization=True)
    doi = Property(cast_type=str, description="The doi of the paper", required=True, weaviate_type=DataType.TEXT, skip_vectorization=True)
    author = Reference(target_collection_name="Author", auto_loading=True, description="The author of the paper", reference_type=Reference_Type.SINGLE, way_type=Reference_Type.TWOWAY, required=False, skip_validation=True)
    co_authors = Reference(target_collection_name="Author", auto_loading=False, description="The co-authors of the paper", reference_type=Reference_Type.LIST, way_type=Reference_Type.ONEWAY, required=False, skip_validation=True)

    _namespace = UUID("eb8bc242-5f59-4a47-8230-0cea6fcc1028")

    def _get_uuid_name_string(self):
        return self.doi
        
class Author(Base_Model):
    first_name = Property(cast_type=str, description="The first name of the author", required=True, weaviate_type=DataType.TEXT, vectorize_property_name=True)
    last_name = Property(cast_type=str, description="The last name of the author", required=True, weaviate_type=DataType.TEXT, vectorize_property_name=True)
    orc_id = Property(cast_type=str, description="The orc_id of the author", required=False, weaviate_type=DataType.TEXT, skip_vectorization=True)
    papers = Reference(target_collection_name="Paper", auto_loading=False, description="The papers of the author", reference_type=Reference_Type.LIST, way_type=Reference_Type.TWOWAY, required=False, skip_validation=True)

    _namespace = UUID("eb8bc242-5f59-4a47-8230-0cea6fcc1028")

    def _get_uuid_name_string(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}"

```

### Create a Weaviate Engine, Register Models, and Create Schema

```python
from weaviate_orm.weaviate_engine import Weaviate_Engine
from weaviate import connect_to_local, connect_to_weaviate_cloud

# Get host and ports from environment variables
host = os.getenv("WEAVIATE_HOST", "vdatabase")
port = int(os.getenv("WEAVIATE_PORT", 8080))
grpc_port = int(os.getenv("WEAVIATE_GRPC_PORT", 50051))

# Initialize the Weaviate engine using the connect_to_local method and its parameters
engine = Weaviate_Engine(connect_to_local, host=host, port=port, grpc_port=grpc_port)

# Register the models with the engine
engine.register_all_models(Paper, Author)

# Create the schema in Weaviate
engine.create_all_schemas()
```

### Create and Save Instances

```python
# Example data
paper_data = {
    "title": "A Study on Weaviate ORM",
    "abstract": "This paper discusses the Weaviate ORM and its features.",
    "pub_date": datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc),
    "doi": "10.1234/weaviate-orm",
}

author_data = {
    "first_name": "Allen",
    "last_name": "Turing",
    "orc_id": "0000-0002-1234-5678",
}

# Create an insance of author and paper

author = Author(first_name=author_data["first_name"],
                last_name=author_data["last_name"],
                orc_id=author_data["orc_id"])

paper = Paper(title=paper_data["title"],
                abstract=paper_data["abstract"],
                pub_date=paper_data["pub_date"],
                doi=paper_data["doi"],
                author=author)

# Save the author and paper to Weaviate
paper.save(include_references=True, recursive=True)
```

### Read an Instance
```python 
# Retrieve the paper by its UUID
paper_uuid = paper.get_uuid()

paper_instance = Paper.get(paper_uuid, include_references=True)
print(f"Paper Title: {paper_instance.title}")
print(f"Author: {paper_instance.author.first_name} {paper_instance.author.last_name}")
```

### Update an Instance
```python
# Update the paper's title
paper_instance.title = "An Updated Study on Weaviate ORM"
paper_instance.update()

#Check updated instance
paper_instance = Paper.get(paper_uuid, include_references=True)
print(f"Paper Title: {paper_instance.title}")
```

### Delete an Instance
```python
# Delete the paper instance
paper_instance.delete()
```
