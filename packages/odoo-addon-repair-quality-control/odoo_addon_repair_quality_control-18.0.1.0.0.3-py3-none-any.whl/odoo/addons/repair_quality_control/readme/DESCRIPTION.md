This module allows to create quality control inspections from repair orders.
One repair order can be linked to many different inspections.

The related inspections can be created either on the confirmation of the repair
order, or when it is done. The creation can be executed manually or
automatically. Both of these aspects are configurable at a company level.

Moreover, you can configure trigger lines at a Product, Product Template or
Product Category level (using the 'Repair' trigger) to set the QC Test to use
when creating the inspections.
