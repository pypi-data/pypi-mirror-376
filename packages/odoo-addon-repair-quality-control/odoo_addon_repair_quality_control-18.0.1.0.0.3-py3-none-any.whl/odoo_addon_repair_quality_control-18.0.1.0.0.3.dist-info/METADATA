This module allows to create quality control inspections from repair
orders. One repair order can be linked to many different inspections.

The related inspections can be created either on the confirmation of the
repair order, or when it is done. The creation can be executed manually
or automatically. Both of these aspects are configurable at a company
level.

Moreover, you can configure trigger lines at a Product, Product Template
or Product Category level (using the 'Repair' trigger) to set the QC
Test to use when creating the inspections.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

Configure the QC repair behavior for the company:

1. Go to Settings > Repair.
2. Configure the two settings related to QC Inspections.

Configure the triggers:

1. Go to Products > Products.
2. Select a product (this product must then be used in a repair order).
3. Go to the 'Inventory' tab.
4. In the 'Quality Control' section, select the QC Test to use when
   creating the inspections, for the 'Repair' trigger.
5. You can also configure the triggers at the product template or
   product category level.

Create a repair order:

1. Go to Repairs > Repair Orders.
2. Create new repair order.
3. Set the repair order to 'Done' or 'Confirmed' state.
4. An inspection should be created automatically or a button should
   appear to allow creating it manually.

You can access from repair order to inspection directly with a smart
button and the same backwards.
