           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

# Accord

Accord brings the robust error handling and optional value patterns from Rust's `Result` and `Option` types to Python. This library provides a type-safe way to handle operations that can fail or may not have a value, leading to more predictable and maintainable code.

We intend not to use any kind of non-std library on Accord, so we do not need any extra dependency as a drawback for using it.

## Why "Accord"?

> The tale I weave for you now is about a puppet that travels the world.
>
> The puppet's goal is to observe how humans live their lives.
>
> This puppet continues its journey still, carrying its large suitcase with it...

## Features

- **`Result<T, E>`**: Represents either a success (`Ok(T)`) or a failure (`Err(E)`).
- **`Option<T>`**: Represents an optional value, being either `Some(T)` or `None`.
- **Ergonomic API**: Methods like `map`, `and_then`, `or_else`, `unwrap`, `expect` provide powerful ways to work with these types.
- **Type Safety**: Leverages Python's type hinting for compile-time checks.
- **Sealed Types**: `Result` and `Option` are sealed, preventing arbitrary subclassing and enforcing usage of provided variants (`Ok`/`Err`, `Some`/`None`).

## Installation

[TBD]

## Usage

### Result

```python
from accord.result import Result, Ok, Err

def divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result[int, str]:
    if b == 0:
        return Err("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    return Ok(a // b)

# Successful operation
result1 = divide(10, 2)
if result1.is_ok():
    print(f"Success: {result1.unwrap()}") # Output: Success: 5
else:
    print(f"Error: {result1.unwrap_err()}")

# Failed operation
result2 = divide(10, 0)
if result2.is_ok():
    print(f"Success: {result2.unwrap()}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result2.unwrap_err()}") # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.

# Using expect for cleaner unwrap with panic message
try:
    value = divide(10, 0).expect("Failed to divide numbers.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e) # Output: Failed to divide numbers.: 'Division by zero is not allowed.'

# Chaining operations with and_then
def add_one_if_even(n: int) -> Result[int, str]:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return Ok(n + 1)
    else:
        return Err("Number is odd")

divide(10, 2).and_then(add_one_if_even) # Ok(5) -> add_one_if_even(5) -> Err("Number is odd")
# Returns: Err('Number is odd')

divide(8, 2).and_then(add_one_if_even) # Ok(4) -> add_one_if_even(4) -> Ok(5)
# Returns: Ok(5)
```

### Option

```python
from accord.option import Option, Some, None

def find_user(user_id: int) -> Option[str]:
    if user_id == 1:
        return Some("Alice")
    return None

user1 = find_user(1)
if user1.is_some():
    print(f"User found: {user1.unwrap()}") # Output: User found: Alice
else:
    print("User not found.")

user2 = find_user(2)
print(f"User: {user2.unwrap_or('Guest')}") # Output: User: Guest

# Using expect
try:
    user_name = find_user(2).expect("User with ID 2 not found.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e) # Output: User with ID 2 not found.

# Mapping over an Option
user_id_option: Option[int] = Some(123)
mapped_option = user_id_option.map(lambda x: f"User ID: {x}") # Some("User ID: 123")
None.map(lambda x: f"User ID: {x}") # None

# Chaining operations with and_then
def get_user_id_as_str(user_id: int) -> Option[str]:
    return Some(str(user_id))

Some(456).and_then(get_user_id_as_str) # Some(456) -> get_user_id_as_str(456) -> Some("456")
# Returns: Some("456")

None.and_then(get_user_id_as_str) # None -> Returns None
# Returns: None
```

## FAQ

### Is this README generated by AI?

Yes.

I was feeling lazy. I'll make it myself in the future.

### What is `Result` and `Option`?

- **`Result<T, E>`**: This type represents the outcome of an operation that might succeed or fail.

  - `Ok(T)`: Indicates success and holds a value of type `T`.
  - `Err(E)`: Indicates failure and holds an error value of type `E`.
  - It's Rust's primary way of handling recoverable errors without exceptions.

- **`Option<T>`**: This type represents a value that might be present or absent.
  - `Some(T)`: Indicates that a value of type `T` is present.
  - `None`: Indicates the absence of a value.
  - It's used for values that are optional, like the result of a search that might not find anything.

### Why use `Result` and `Option` in Python?

Python traditionally uses exceptions for errors and `None` for optional values. However, `Result` and `Option` offer several benefits:

- **Explicit Error Handling**: `Result` forces you to consider the error case at compile time (with type checkers) or runtime, making error handling more deliberate than relying on buried exceptions.
- **Clearer Intent**: `Option` makes it explicit when a value might be missing, distinguishing it from other forms of "empty" or "null" that might arise from different contexts.
- **Functional Programming Patterns**: These types are monadic, enabling elegant chaining of operations using methods like `map` and `and_then`, leading to more expressive and composable code.
- **Avoids `None` Ambiguity**: In Python, `None` can sometimes be ambiguous. `Option` clearly separates the absence of a value from other potential "falsy" values.

### How do `Ok`/`Err` and `Some`/`None` relate to `Result`/`Option`?

`Result` and `Option` are abstract base classes (or type aliases) that define the common interface. `Ok` and `Err` are concrete implementations of `Result`, and `Some` is a concrete implementation of `Option` (with `None` being a singleton for the absence of a value). You will always create an instance of `Ok`, `Err`, or `Some` (or use the `None` singleton), not directly of `Result` or `Option` themselves.

### What does "Sealed" mean?

When `Result` (and `Option`) are "sealed," it means that only the predefined variants (`Ok`, `Err` for `Result`; `Some`, `None` for `Option`) are allowed to inherit from them. This prevents users of the library from creating their own custom `Result` or `Option` types, ensuring that all `Result` or `Option` values are one of the intended, known types.

### What is the difference between `unwrap()` and `expect()`?

- **`unwrap()`**: Attempts to get the contained value. If the operation fails (`Err` or `None`), it raises a generic `RuntimeError` (or the original error for `Result.unwrap()`).
- **`expect(message)`**: Attempts to get the contained value. If the operation fails (`Err` or `None`), it raises a `RuntimeError` that includes your custom `message` along with the original error, providing more context about _why_ the operation was expected to succeed.
