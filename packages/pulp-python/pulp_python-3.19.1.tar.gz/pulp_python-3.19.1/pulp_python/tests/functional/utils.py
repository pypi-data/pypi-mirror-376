    Tests that the simple api at `url` matches the packages supplied.
    `packages`: dictionary of form {package_name: [release_filenames]}
    First check `/simple/index.html` has each package name, no more, no less
    Second check `/simple/package_name/index.html` for each package exists
    Third check each package's index has all their releases listed, no more, no less
    Returns tuple (`proper`: bool, `error_msg`: str)
    *Technically, if there was a bug, other packages' indexes could be posted, but not present
    in the simple index and thus be accessible from the distribution, but if one can't see it
    how would one know that it's there?*
