class WalletCredentials(BaseModel):
    """
    Represents wallet credentials for blockchain operations.

    This model contains the essential information needed for wallet operations:
    the public address, private key, and network identifier.

    **Key Features:**
    - Secure storage of wallet credentials
    - Network-specific validation
    - Simple structure for wallet operations

    **Security Notes:**
    - Private keys should be handled with extreme care
    - This model is typically used for temporary operations
    - Consider encryption for long-term storage

    **Usage Examples:**
    ```python
    # Create wallet credentials
    credentials = WalletCredentials(
        address="0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6",
        private_key="0x1234567890abcdef...",
        network="erc20"
    )

    # Use for wallet operations
    print(f"Address: {credentials.address}")
    print(f"Network: {credentials.network}")
    ```

    **Relationships:**
    - Used by NetworkClient for wallet generation and transfers
    - Temporary storage for wallet operations
    - Network-specific validation and operations
