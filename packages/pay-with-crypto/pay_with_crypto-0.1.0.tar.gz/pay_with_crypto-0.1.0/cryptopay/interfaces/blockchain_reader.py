    Abstract interface for blockchain transaction monitoring and network operations.
    
    This interface defines the contract for reading blockchain data, including
    searching for transactions and getting network information. Can be implemented
    using RPC nodes or third-party APIs.
    
    **Key Operations:**
    - Search new transactions for wallet addresses
    - Get network status
