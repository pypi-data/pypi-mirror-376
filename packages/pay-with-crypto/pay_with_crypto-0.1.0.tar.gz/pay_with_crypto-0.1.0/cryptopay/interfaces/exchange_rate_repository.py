    Abstract interface for exchange rate storage and retrieval operations.
    
    This interface defines the contract for exchange rate-related database operations,
    including storing, retrieving, and updating cryptocurrency exchange rates.
    
    **Key Operations:**
    - Get saved exchange rate by fiat_currency and crypto_currency
    - Update exchange rate (last_updated_at, rate, reverted_rate)
    - Retrieve exchange rates by currency pairs
