# FastFermion

**fastfermion** is a fast library written in C++ for manipulating polynomials in Pauli, Fermi and Majorana operators.

**Features**

* Algebraic manipulation of polynomials in Pauli operators, Fermionic creation/annihilation operators, and Majorana operators.
* Fermionic and Majorana operators are automatically put in normal ordered form
* Conversion between Pauli, Fermi, and Majorana representations (Jordan-Wigner and reverse Jordan-Wigner)
* Sparse matrix representations
* Heisenberg evolution: Propagate polynomial through a sequence of unitaries/gates with possible truncation by degree
* Interface with OpenFermion and Cirq
* Up to 100x faster than OpenFermion
* More to come ...
