        :param scope: The scope in which to define this construct.
        :param id_: The scoped construct ID. Must be unique amongst siblings in the same scope
        :param name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with `RFC1035 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt>`_. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression '`a-z <%5B-a-z0-9%5D*%5Ba-z0-9%5D>`_?' which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#name GoogleComputeForwardingRule#name}
        :param allow_global_access: This field is used along with the 'backend_service' field for internal load balancing or with the 'target' field for internal TargetInstance. If the field is set to 'TRUE', clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load balancer. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#allow_global_access GoogleComputeForwardingRule#allow_global_access}
        :param allow_psc_global_access: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether the PSC endpoint can be accessed from another region. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#allow_psc_global_access GoogleComputeForwardingRule#allow_psc_global_access}
        :param all_ports: The 'ports', 'portRange', and 'allPorts' fields are mutually exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The 'allPorts' field has the following limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, SCTP, or L3_DEFAULT. - It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding. - Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The L3_DEFAULT protocol requires 'allPorts' be set to true. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#all_ports GoogleComputeForwardingRule#all_ports}
        :param backend_service: Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic. Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing; must be omitted for all other load balancer types. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#backend_service GoogleComputeForwardingRule#backend_service}
        :param description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#description GoogleComputeForwardingRule#description}
        :param id: Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#id GoogleComputeForwardingRule#id}. Please be aware that the id field is automatically added to all resources in Terraform providers using a Terraform provider SDK version below 2. If you experience problems setting this value it might not be settable. Please take a look at the provider documentation to ensure it should be settable.
        :param ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced 'target' or 'backendService'. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an 'IPAddress' is required under the following circumstances: - When the 'target' is set to 'targetGrpcProxy' and 'validateForProxyless' is set to 'true', the 'IPAddress' should be set to '0.0.0.0'. - When the 'target' is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an 'IPAddress'. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: - IP address number, as in '100.1.2.3' - IPv6 address range, as in '2600:1234::/96' - Full resource URL, as in 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - Partial URL or by name, as in: - 'projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'global/addresses/address-name' - 'address-name' The forwarding rule's 'target' or 'backendService', and in most cases, also the 'loadBalancingScheme', determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see `IP address specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_. When reading an 'IPAddress', the API always returns the IP address number. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#ip_address GoogleComputeForwardingRule#ip_address}
        :param ip_collection: Resource reference of a PublicDelegatedPrefix. The PDP must be a sub-PDP in EXTERNAL_IPV6_FORWARDING_RULE_CREATION mode. Use one of the following formats to specify a sub-PDP when creating an IPv6 NetLB forwarding rule using BYOIP: Full resource URL, as in: - 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{{projectId}}/regions/{{region}}/publicDelegatedPrefixes/{{sub-pdp-name}}' Partial URL, as in: - 'projects/{{projectId}}/regions/region/publicDelegatedPrefixes/{{sub-pdp-name}}' - 'regions/{{region}}/publicDelegatedPrefixes/{{sub-pdp-name}}' Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#ip_collection GoogleComputeForwardingRule#ip_collection}
        :param ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid options are 'TCP', 'UDP', 'ESP', 'AH', 'SCTP', 'ICMP' and 'L3_DEFAULT'. The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products as described in `Load balancing features <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends>`_. A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol. A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP. Possible values: ["TCP", "UDP", "ESP", "AH", "SCTP", "ICMP", "L3_DEFAULT"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#ip_protocol GoogleComputeForwardingRule#ip_protocol}
        :param ip_version: The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6. If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default. Possible values: ["IPV4", "IPV6"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#ip_version GoogleComputeForwardingRule#ip_version}
        :param is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a 'PacketMirroring' rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their 'loadBalancingScheme' set to 'INTERNAL'. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#is_mirroring_collector GoogleComputeForwardingRule#is_mirroring_collector}
        :param labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule. A list of key->value pairs. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#labels GoogleComputeForwardingRule#labels}
        :param load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type. Note that an empty string value ('""') is also supported for some use cases, for example PSC (private service connection) regional forwarding rules. For more information about forwarding rules, refer to `Forwarding rule concepts <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts>`_. Default value: "EXTERNAL" Possible values: ["EXTERNAL", "EXTERNAL_MANAGED", "INTERNAL", "INTERNAL_MANAGED"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#load_balancing_scheme GoogleComputeForwardingRule#load_balancing_scheme}
        :param network: This field is not used for external load balancing. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used. If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will be used. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must be provided. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#network GoogleComputeForwardingRule#network}
        :param network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load balancer and can only take the following values: 'PREMIUM', 'STANDARD'. For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are 'PREMIUM' and 'STANDARD'. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is 'PREMIUM'. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be 'PREMIUM'. If 'IPAddress' is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address. Possible values: ["PREMIUM", "STANDARD"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#network_tier GoogleComputeForwardingRule#network_tier}
        :param no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#no_automate_dns_zone GoogleComputeForwardingRule#no_automate_dns_zone}
        :param port_range: The 'ports', 'portRange', and 'allPorts' fields are mutually exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The 'portRange' field has the following limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN. - Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See `port specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications>`_ for details. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's.
        :param ports: The 'ports', 'portRange', and 'allPorts' fields are mutually exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The 'ports' field has the following limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancers, and internal protocol forwarding. - You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by commas. The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair if they share at least one port number. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair if they share at least one port number.
        :param project: Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#project GoogleComputeForwardingRule#project}.
        :param recreate_closed_psc: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to make terraform recreate the ForwardingRule when the status is closed. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#recreate_closed_psc GoogleComputeForwardingRule#recreate_closed_psc}
        :param region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#region GoogleComputeForwardingRule#region}
        :param service_directory_registrations: service_directory_registrations block. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#service_directory_registrations GoogleComputeForwardingRule#service_directory_registrations}
        :param service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule. If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service name. The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression '`a-z <%5B-a-z0-9%5D*%5Ba-z0-9%5D>`_?' which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#service_label GoogleComputeForwardingRule#service_label}
        :param source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24). Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#source_ip_ranges GoogleComputeForwardingRule#source_ip_ranges}
        :param subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and network load balancing with IPv6. If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#subnetwork GoogleComputeForwardingRule#subnetwork}
        :param target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type appropriate to the target object. - For load balancers, see the "Target" column in `Port specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to managed services, the target must be a service attachment. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#target GoogleComputeForwardingRule#target}
        :param timeouts: timeouts block. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#timeouts GoogleComputeForwardingRule#timeouts}

        :param allow_global_access: This field is used along with the 'backend_service' field for internal load balancing or with the 'target' field for internal TargetInstance. If the field is set to 'TRUE', clients can access ILB from all regions. Otherwise only allows access from clients in the same region as the internal load balancer.

Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The 'allPorts' field has the following limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, SCTP, or L3_DEFAULT. - It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding. - Set this field to true to allow packets addressed to any port or packets lacking destination port information (for example, UDP fragments after the first fragment) to be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The L3_DEFAULT protocol requires 'allPorts' be set to true.

        :param backend_service: Identifies the backend service to which the forwarding rule sends traffic. Required for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing; must be omitted for all other load balancer types. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#backend_service GoogleComputeForwardingRule#backend_service}
        :param description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#description GoogleComputeForwardingRule#description}

Please be aware that the id field is automatically added to all resources in Terraform providers using a Terraform provider SDK version below 2. If you experience problems setting this value it might not be settable. Please take a look at the provider documentation to ensure it should be settable.
        :param ip_address: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to the referenced 'target' or 'backendService'. While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an 'IPAddress' is required under the following circumstances: - When the 'target' is set to 'targetGrpcProxy' and 'validateForProxyless' is set to 'true', the 'IPAddress' should be set to '0.0.0.0'. - When the 'target' is a Private Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an 'IPAddress'. Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a forwarding rule: - IP address number, as in '100.1.2.3' - IPv6 address range, as in '2600:1234::/96' - Full resource URL, as in 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - Partial URL or by name, as in: - 'projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'regions/region/addresses/address-name' - 'global/addresses/address-name' - 'address-name' The forwarding rule's 'target' or 'backendService', and in most cases, also the 'loadBalancingScheme', determine the type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see `IP address specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_. When reading an 'IPAddress', the API always returns the IP address number.

        :param ip_collection: Resource reference of a PublicDelegatedPrefix. The PDP must be a sub-PDP in EXTERNAL_IPV6_FORWARDING_RULE_CREATION mode. Use one of the following formats to specify a sub-PDP when creating an IPv6 NetLB forwarding rule using BYOIP: Full resource URL, as in: - 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{{projectId}}/regions/{{region}}/publicDelegatedPrefixes/{{sub-pdp-name}}' Partial URL, as in: - 'projects/{{projectId}}/regions/region/publicDelegatedPrefixes/{{sub-pdp-name}}' - 'regions/{{region}}/publicDelegatedPrefixes/{{sub-pdp-name}}' Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#ip_collection GoogleComputeForwardingRule#ip_collection}
        :param ip_protocol: The IP protocol to which this rule applies. For protocol forwarding, valid options are 'TCP', 'UDP', 'ESP', 'AH', 'SCTP', 'ICMP' and 'L3_DEFAULT'. The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products as described in `Load balancing features <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends>`_. A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol. A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP. Possible values: ["TCP", "UDP", "ESP", "AH", "SCTP", "ICMP", "L3_DEFAULT"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#ip_protocol GoogleComputeForwardingRule#ip_protocol}
        :param ip_version: The IP address version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid options are IPV4 and IPV6. If not set, the IPv4 address will be used by default.

        :param is_mirroring_collector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops, instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored even if a 'PacketMirroring' rule applies to them. This can only be set to true for load balancers that have their 'loadBalancingScheme' set to 'INTERNAL'. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#is_mirroring_collector GoogleComputeForwardingRule#is_mirroring_collector}
        :param labels: Labels to apply to this forwarding rule. A list of key->value pairs. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#labels GoogleComputeForwardingRule#labels}
        :param load_balancing_scheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type. Note that an empty string value ('""') is also supported for some use cases, for example PSC (private service connection) regional forwarding rules. For more information about forwarding rules, refer to `Forwarding rule concepts <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts>`_. Default value: "EXTERNAL" Possible values: ["EXTERNAL", "EXTERNAL_MANAGED", "INTERNAL", "INTERNAL_MANAGED"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#load_balancing_scheme GoogleComputeForwardingRule#load_balancing_scheme}
        :param network: This field is not used for external load balancing. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used. If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will be used. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network must be provided.

        :param network_tier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this load balancer and can only take the following values: 'PREMIUM', 'STANDARD'. For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are 'PREMIUM' and 'STANDARD'. For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is 'PREMIUM'. If this field is not specified, it is assumed to be 'PREMIUM'. If 'IPAddress' is specified, this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address. Possible values: ["PREMIUM", "STANDARD"] Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#network_tier GoogleComputeForwardingRule#network_tier}
        :param no_automate_dns_zone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC forwarding rules do not use this field. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#no_automate_dns_zone GoogleComputeForwardingRule#no_automate_dns_zone}
        :param port_range: The 'ports', 'portRange', and 'allPorts' fields are mutually exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The 'portRange' field has the following limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN. - Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See `port specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications>`_ for details. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair, and cannot have overlapping 'portRange's.
        :param ports: The 'ports', 'portRange', and 'allPorts' fields are mutually exclusive. Only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the backends configured with this forwarding rule. The 'ports' field has the following limitations: - It requires that the forwarding rule 'IPProtocol' be TCP, UDP, or SCTP, and - It's applicable only to the following products: internal passthrough Network Load Balancers, backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancers, and internal protocol forwarding. - You can specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by commas. The ports can be contiguous or discontiguous. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair if they share at least one port number. For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same '[IPAddress, IPProtocol]' pair if they share at least one port number.
        :param project: Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#project GoogleComputeForwardingRule#project}.
        :param recreate_closed_psc: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to make terraform recreate the ForwardingRule when the status is closed. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#recreate_closed_psc GoogleComputeForwardingRule#recreate_closed_psc}
        :param region: A reference to the region where the regional forwarding rule resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules.

        :param service_label: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule. If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service name. The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression '`a-z <%5B-a-z0-9%5D*%5Ba-z0-9%5D>`_?' which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing. Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#service_label GoogleComputeForwardingRule#service_label}
        :param source_ip_ranges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64 source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range (for example, 1.2.3.0/24). Docs at Terraform Registry: {@link https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google-beta/6.49.3/docs/resources/google_compute_forwarding_rule#source_ip_ranges GoogleComputeForwardingRule#source_ip_ranges}
        :param subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load balancing and network load balancing with IPv6. If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, a subnetwork must be specified if the network is in custom subnet mode or when creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.

        When a client
        sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
        to the referenced 'target' or 'backendService'.

        While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an 'IPAddress' is
        required under the following circumstances:

        - When the 'target' is set to 'targetGrpcProxy' and
          'validateForProxyless' is set to 'true', the
          'IPAddress' should be set to '0.0.0.0'.
        - When the 'target' is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
          bundle, you must specify an 'IPAddress'.

        Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
        existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
        assigns an ephemeral IP address.

        Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
        forwarding rule:

        - IP address number, as in '100.1.2.3'
        - IPv6 address range, as in '2600:1234::/96'
        - Full resource URL, as in
          'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name'
        - Partial URL or by name, as in:

          - 'projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name'
          - 'regions/region/addresses/address-name'
          - 'global/addresses/address-name'
          - 'address-name'

        The forwarding rule's 'target' or 'backendService',
        and in most cases, also the 'loadBalancingScheme', determine the
        type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
        `IP address
        specifications <https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications>`_.

        When reading an 'IPAddress', the API always returns the IP
        address number.
