## How to use on your own local Windows/Linux/Macbook laptop?

# Using docker, running within docker container
* Download and install docker desktop: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* After installation, launch/run docker desktop and if it asks, login using your docker credentials.
* Launch any command line (for example, cmd on windows or terminal on Mac) and type 
```
docker pull pkjmesra/pkscreener:latest
```
Then type 
```
docker run -it pkjmesra/pkscreener:latest
```
The option `-i` will open the `pkscreener` in interactive mode within docker. `-t` will allocate a pseudo terminal for you so you can begin to use `pkscreener`

# Special notes on vulnerabilities shown in the docker image/container
Please keep in mind that only because the container/image shows a vulnerability, it does not mean that it exists in this particular image.
1. If you see a critical vulnerability being shown for git, it's ONLY IF we use git with v2.13 or below AND we use git submodule. In case of PKScreener, both are false. We use git >= 2.45 and we DO NOT use git submodules. See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32002
2. If you see high severity vulnerability for pip, it's ONLY IF we use a private indexed repository. In our case, we only use PyPi - a public python library repository. See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20225.
3. If you see high severity vulnerability for usage of library Pillow, it's ONLY IF we try to generate an image containing text that can uncontrollably lengthy. In PKScreener, the image is NEVER generated locally on your laptop or docker container. It is generated only when running in telegram-bot for morning/afternoon analysis alerts. Additionally, there are checks to ensure we never go beyond the maximum size of the number of columns in the analysis tables. To conclude, the image generation module never gets activated on docker/locally on your laptop. See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44271

The story is similar for other low severity vulnerabilities that docker might show. If you're genuinely concerned, you can search with the respective CVE # in the NIST database to understand more or create an issue https://github.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/issues . We keep reviewing all vulnerabilties regularly and fix those immediately if at all they are likely to impact us or our users.

# Installing the latest version from PyPi.
* Go ahead and install using `pip install pkscreener`. The releases page also has the latest wheels for multiple platforms.
* This should install all of the major dependencies, except maybe, TA-Lib.
* This app can still run without TA-Lib, but if you need to install TA-Lib for technical indicators (which otherwise is used from `pandas_ta_classic` in the absence of TA-Lib), you can do this: Head to `.github/dependencies/` under this repo. Download the respective TA-Lib file/whl file and install either from the .whl file or from source. Check out any of the workflow files for steps to install TA-Lib.

For example:

For `Windows`: See https://github.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/blob/c1e94ba3137915cb781161fa2d5fb69129940fd3/.github/workflows/w1-workflow-build-matrix.yml#L91-L101 

For `Mac`: Run `brew install ta-lib` assuming you have homebrew installed.

For `Ubuntu/Linux`: See https://github.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/blob/main/.github/workflows/w1-workflow-build-matrix.yml#L121-L132

* Now launch your favorite command line CLI and issue `pkscreener`. This will launch the pkscreener executable.

# Building from source repo
* Install python 3.12 for your OS/CPU. Download the installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/#Files
* Just clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener.git`
* `cd PKScreener`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` .
* (Optional) If you would like to have technical indicators evaluated using TA-Lib, go ahead and install TA-Lib as well. `pip3 install ta-lib`. Please review additional steps to buil TA-Lib in the workflow files meant for your OS under .github > workflows and follow the line numbers from the previous section.
* `cd pkscreener`
* Finally, from within the `pkscreener` directory, run `python pkscreenercli.py`. Or just type/run `pkscreener`. You are all set.

# Running the executables
* Download the suitable file according to your OS.
* Linux & Mac users should make sure that the `pkscreenercli_x64.bin or pkscreenercli_x64.run` is having `execute` permission. (`chmod +x pkscreenercli_x64.run`)

* **Run** the file. Following window will appear.


* **Configure** the parameters as per your requirement using `Option > E`.

It also shows you how the chosen scan option has fared in the past. 1-Pd, 2-Pd means 1 day, 2 days from the date of scan in the past when those stocks came into the results of the chosen scan option.

![results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/main/screenshots/result_analysis.png)
* Once done, you can also save the results in an excel file.

## Growth of 10k

You can see the performance of your stocks and/or at portfolio level using "Growth of 10k".

![G10k](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/main/screenshots/G10k.png)

It also summarises the Growth of 10k at portfolio level for the last quarter so that you know which filters worked best in the past:

![G10k_Sum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/main/screenshots/G10k_Sum.png)

## Backtests
You can now use the *Backtests* menu to backtest any of the selected strategies. See https://pkjmesra.github.io/PKScreener/BacktestReports.html

![backtest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/main/screenshots/backtest.png)

* Once done, you can also view the output html file saved at the same location from where you launched the app.

## Scanning as a scheduled job once or at regular intervals
* Running it once with pre-defined inputs
  You can also run it as a one time job in any scheduler with pre-defined options. For example `./pkscreenercli.py -a Y -o X:12:10 -e` (or `pkscreenercli.exe -a Y -o X:12:10 -e` if you're executing with the exe) will run the scanner for all Nifty stocks and find all stocks matching CCI filter, save the results in xlsx file and exit. `./pkscreenercli.py -a Y -o X:12:9:2.5 -e` will run the scanner (menu option `X`) for all Nifty stocks (menu option `12`) to find volume gainers (menu option `9`) with at least the volume multiplier of 2.5 (input variable `2.5`), save the results in xlsx file and exit (menu option `-e`). Passing in the `-p` option for example `pkscreenercli.py -a Y -p -o X:12:6:1 -e` will also silence all command line prints/outputs and just run silently for the given options, save results and exit. Try and see all options with `./pkscreenercli.py -h`.

* Running it at regular intervals
  If you want to runn it at regular intervals, you can just pass the interval in `-c` command line option. For example, `./pkscreenercli.py -a Y -o X:12:6:1 -c 180` will run it every `180` seconds with console outputs also being printed. If you'd just like it to run as a cron job without console outputs, you may also pass the `-p` parameter. For example, `./pkscreenercli.py -a Y -p -o X:12:6:1 -c 180`

## Understanding the Result Table:

The Result table contains a lot of different parameters which can be pretty overwhelming to the new users, so here's the description and significance of each parameter.

| Sr  |       Parameter       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Example                                                                                  |

|  1  |       **Stock**       | This is a NSE scrip symbol. If your OS/Terminal supports unicode, You can directly open **[TradingView](https://in.tradingview.com/)** charts by pressing `Ctrl+Click` on the stock name.                                    | [TATAMOTORS](https://in.tradingview.com/chart?symbol=NSE%3ATATAMOTORS)                   |
|  2  |   **Consolidating**   | It gives the price range in which stock is trading since last `N` days. `N` is configurable and can be modified by executing `Edit User Configuration` option.                                                               | If stock is trading between price 100-120 in last 30 days, Output will be `Range:20.0 %` |
|  3  | **Breakout (N Days)** | This is pure magic! The `BO` is Breakout level in last N days while `R` is the next resistance level if available. Investor should consider both BO & R level to decide entry/exits in their trades.                         | `B:302, R:313`(Breakout level is 100 & Next resistance is 102)                           |
|  4  |        **LTP**        | LTP is the Last Traded Price of an asset traded on NSE.                                                                                                                                                                      | `298.7` (Stock is trading at this price)                                                 |

## Hack it your way:
Feel free to Edit the parameters in the `pkscreener.ini` file which will be generated by the application.
```
[config]
period = 1y
daystolookback = 22
duration = 1d
minprice = 20.0
maxprice = 50000.0
volumeratio = 2.5
consolidationpercentage = 10.0
shuffle = y
cachestockdata = y
onlystagetwostocks = y
useema = n
showunknowntrends = y
logsenabled = n
generaltimeout = 2.0
longtimeout = 4.0
maxnetworkretrycount = 10
backtestperiod = 60
minimumvolume = 10000
```
Try to tweak this parameters as per your trading styles. For example, If you're comfortable with weekly charts, make `duration=5d` and so on. For intraday, you can set `period=1d and duration=5m` if you would like to calculate with 5minute candles. Set the duration to `15m` or whatever value you desire, but keep the period to `1d`. This tool, however, works best for short/mid term instead of intraday, but some scans like momentum/volume/NR4 etc can be used for screening stocks for intraday as well. You can use the toggle menu option `T` to toggle between long term and intraday config before you begin the scanners.

## Creating your own Telegram channel to receive your own alerts:
You can create your own telegram channel to receive alerts wherenevr you run it locally on your laptop either from a command line interface console or run it as a scheduler. Simply, go ahead and
1. Create a bot for yourself, then a channel and get their IDs. Follow the steps in https://medium.com/codex/using-python-to-send-telegram-messages-in-3-simple-steps-419a8b5e5e2 and https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token
2. After you have created the bot using `botFather` and have received/verified your bot id/token and channel ID using `get id bot`, simply go to `pkscreener` folder in the source code directory and create a `.env.dev` file with the following (If you are instead using the .exe or .bin or .run file from release, just create this file in the same folder where the executable (.exe or .bin or .run) is placed.)
```
CHAT_ID=Your_Channel_Id_Here_Without_A_Hyphen_or_Minus_Sign
TOKEN=Your_Bot_Token_Here
chat_idADMIN=Your_Own_ID_Here
```
3. From now on, you will begin to receive your own alerts on your telegram channel.

## Troubleshooting and Logs:
If you are having issues running the program, you can just launch a command line interface (On windows> Start > Run > cmd) and then launch PKScreener with a command line option of `-l`. For example, `python pkscreenercli.py -l`. This will show you the path where the program will save all the log outputs from this run. Copy that path and go ahead and run the application. Altenatively, you can just go ahead and modify the `logsEnabled` value to `y`, save & close it and then run `python pkscreenercli.py`.

After you have finished the run, go to that copied path, zip the contents of the file `pkscreener-logs.txt` and create an issue at https://github.com/pkjmesra/PKScreener/issues. Please do not forget to attach the log files in the issue.
