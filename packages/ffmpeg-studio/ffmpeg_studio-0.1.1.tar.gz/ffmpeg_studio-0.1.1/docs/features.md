FFmpeg-Studio extends the power of FFmpeg with a clean, Pythonic interface.

This library simplifies complex command construction, provides tools for safe quoting and escaping, and offers robust mechanisms for handling both input and output streams. It aims to make FFmpeg’s advanced capabilities more approachable while preserving its flexibility.

## Design

The core design focuses on generating filters, tracking progress in real time, and integrating seamlessly with Python applications. It provides a solid foundation for building media processing pipelines ranging from simple format conversions to large-scale video processing tasks.


## Filter generation
FFmpeg-Studio makes it easier to construct complex filter graphs by offering built-in filters and a flexible base class for creating custom ones. This allows you to chain together sophisticated transformations without manually managing the intricate FFmpeg syntax.

## Input and output management
The library provides tools to handle multiple input streams and direct their outputs precisely. Stream selection and mapping are simplified, enabling workflows where different audio, video, or subtitle tracks need to be processed or combined.

## Progress tracking
With built-in callbacks, FFmpeg-Studio can track processing progress in real time. This is useful for monitoring long-running tasks or integrating into user-facing applications that require live feedback.

## Metadata and probing
The library integrates FFprobe to scan and extract metadata, giving you detailed insights into your media files. This helps when deciding how to structure conversions, analyze streams, or build dynamic workflows.

## Direct control with flags
For scenarios requiring precise tuning, FFmpeg-Studio allows direct use of FFmpeg flags. This means you get the best of both worlds—Pythonic simplicity with the ability to drop down into raw FFmpeg power when needed.

## Scalable pipelines
Long filter graphs and complex command structures are supported, making it possible to build production-grade media pipelines that can scale from quick experiments to full-scale automation.
