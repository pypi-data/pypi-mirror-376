# TorchGDM
> nano-optics full-field solver, written in PyTorch.

TorchGDM is a PyTorch implementation of the [Green's dyadic method (GDM)](https://doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/68/8/R05), a electro-dynamics full-field volume integral technique. It's main features are multi-scale simulations **combining volume discretized and effective e/m polarizability models**, as well as the general support of torch's **automatic differentiation**. 

TorchGDM is available on the [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/wiechapeter/torchgdm) and via [PyPi and pip](https://pypi.org/project/torchgdm/).  Please visit also the [TorchGDM documentation website](https://homepages.laas.fr/pwiecha/torchgdm_doc/).

TorchGDM is originally based on various theoretical works by [Christian Girard](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=P3HnK28AAAAJ) at CEMES (see e.g. [Ch. Girard 2005 Rep. Prog. Phys. 68 1883](https://doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/68/8/R05)), with contributions from G. Colas des Francs, A. Arbouet, R. Marty, C. Majorel, A. Patoux, Y. Brûlé, S. Ponomareva, A. Azéma and P. R. Wiecha.

## Getting started

Simulate and plot the scattering cross section spectrum between 550nm and 950nm of a GaN nano-cube (240nm side length), placed in vacuum, illuminated by an x-polarized plane wave:

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torchgdm as tg

# --- simulation setup
# - vacuum environment
mat_env = tg.materials.MatConstant(eps=1.0)
env = tg.env.EnvHomogeneous3D(env_material=mat_env)

# - illumination field(s) and wavelength
wavelengths = torch.linspace(550.0, 950.0, 25)
plane_wave = tg.env.freespace_3d.PlaneWave(e0p=1.0, e0s=0.0)

# - discretized structure
structure = tg.struct3d.StructDiscretizedCubic3D(
    discretization_config=tg.struct3d.cube(l=8),
    step=30.0,    # in nm
    materials=tg.materials.MatDatabase("GaN"),
)

# - define and run simulation.
sim = tg.Simulation(
    structures=[structure],
    illumination_fields=[plane_wave],
    environment=env,
    wavelengths=wavelengths,
)
sim.plot_structure()  # visualize structure
sim.run()             # run the main simulation

# - post-processing: cross sections
cs_results = sim.get_spectra_crosssections()

# plot
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 4))
plt.plot(tg.to_np(wavelengths), tg.to_np(cs_results["scs"]))
plt.xlabel("wavelength (nm)")
plt.ylabel("scs (nm^2)")
plt.show()
```


### GPU support

TorchGDM was tested on [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) GPUs and [google TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu). All you need is a [GPU enabled version of pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Running on GPU can be enabled by using:

```python
  import torchgdm as tg
  tg.use_cuda(True)
```

Alternatively, GPU usage can be controlled by setting the device manually:

```python
  sim = tg.Simulation(...)
  sim.set_device("cuda")
```

## Installing / Requirements

TorchGDM is pure python. Installation via pip is possible on all major operating systems:

```shell
pip install -U torchgdm
```

TorchGDM was tested under linux and windows with python versions 3.9 to 3.12. 
It requires following python packages

- **pytorch** (v2.6+)
- **numpy**

Following not strictly required packages will be automatically installed:

- **scipy** (for several tools)
- **tqdm** (progress bars)
- **pyyaml** (support for refractiveindex.info permittivity data)
- **matplotlib** (2d plotting)
- **alphashape** (2d contour plotting)
- **psutil** (for automatic memory purge)

Further optional dependencies

- **treams** (for T-matrix and Mie theory tools)
- **pyvista** (3d visualizations)
- **ipywidgets**, **jupyterlab** and **trame** (for jupyter inline 3D visualizations)
- **scikit-learn** (automatic GPM extraction)
- **pymiecs** (for some Mie theory unit tests)

(install all optional dependencies via pip: `pip install -U torchgdm[all]`)
