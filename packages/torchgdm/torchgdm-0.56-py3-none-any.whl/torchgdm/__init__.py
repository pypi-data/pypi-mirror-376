TorchGDM - nano-optics + auto-diff

A full-field electrodynamical Green's Dyadic Method solver with 
support for effective E/M polarizabilities, written in pytorch. 




Core classes
============

Two classes provide high-level access to the core functionalities:

.. currentmodule:: torchgdm

.. autosummary::
   :recursive:
   :toctree: generated/

   Simulation
   Field
   

Simulation description
======================

The simulation takes a list of structures, the environment and a list 
of illumination fields as main inputs. 
The respective classes are found in following sub packages:

Structures
----------

The sub-packages :mod:`struct3d.volume` and :mod:`struct2d.surface` 
contain also discretizations for a selection of geometric primitives.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   struct2d
   struct3d


Materials
----------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   materials


Environments and illuminations
------------------------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   env.freespace_2d
   env.freespace_3d

*Note:* Illumination fields are associated with each environment. 
They can be found in the respective base environment package
(:mod:`env.freespace_2d` and :mod:`env.freespace_3d`).


Postprocessing and Tools
========================

Most postprocessing and visualization tools are accessible also through 
the :class:`Simulation` and :class:`Field` classes. 
Alternatively the functional API can be used:

Post processing
---------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   postproc
   postproc.crosssect
   postproc.fields
   postproc.multipole
   postproc.green


Visualization
-------------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/
   :recursive:

   visu.visu2d
   visu.visu3d


Tools
-----

For detailed documentation, see:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

    tools


Many tools are used mainly internally. The most relevant tool modules are:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/
    
    tools.geometry
    tools.mie


CUDA GPU acceleration
=====================

TorchGDM exposes a few top level helper functions for CUDA usage:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

    to_np
    use_cuda
    set_default_device
    get_default_device
