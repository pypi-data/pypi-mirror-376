# CocoIndex Query Support

The main functionality of CocoIndex is indexing.
The goal of indexing is to enable efficient querying against your data.
You can use any libraries or frameworks of your choice to perform queries.
At the same time, CocoIndex provides seamless integration between indexing and querying workflows.
For example, you can share transformations between indexing and querying, and easily retrieve table names when using CocoIndex's default naming conventions.

## Transform Flow

Sometimes a part of the transformation logic needs to be shared between indexing and querying,
e.g. when we build a vector index and query against it, the embedding computation needs to be consistent between indexing and querying.

In this case, you can:

1.  Extract a sub-flow with the shared transformation logic into a standalone function.
    *   It takes one or more data slices as input.
    *   It returns one data slice as output.
    *   You need to annotate data types for both inputs and outputs as type parameter for `cocoindex.DataSlice[T]`. See [data types](./core/data_types.mdx) for more details about supported data types.

2.  When you're defining your indexing flow, you can directly call the function.
    The body will be executed, so that the transformation logic will be added as part of the indexing flow.

3.  At query time, you usually want to directly run the function with specific input data, instead of letting it called as part of a long-lived indexing flow.
    To do this, declare the function as a *transform flow*, by decorating it with `@cocoindex.transform_flow()`.
    This will add `eval()` and `eval_async()` methods to the function, so that you can directly call with specific input data.

For example, based on the flow in [quickstart](getting_started/quickstart), you can extract the invocation of `SentenceTransformerEmbed` into a standalone function:

```python
@cocoindex.transform_flow()
def text_to_embedding(text: cocoindex.DataSlice[str]) -> cocoindex.DataSlice[NDArray[np.float32]]:
    return text.transform(
        cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
            model="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"))
```

When you're defining your indexing flow, you can directly call the function:

```python
with doc["chunks"].row() as chunk:
    chunk["embedding"] = text_to_embedding(chunk["text"])
```

or, using the `call()` method of the transform flow on the first argument, to make operations chainable:

```python
with doc["chunks"].row() as chunk:
    chunk["embedding"] = chunk["text"].call(text_to_embedding)
```

Any time, you can call the `eval()` method with specific string, which will return a `NDArray[np.float32]`:

```python
print(text_to_embedding.eval("Hello, world!"))
```

If you're in an async context, please call the `eval_async()` method instead:

```python
print(await text_to_embedding.eval_async("Hello, world!"))
```

## Get Target Native Names

In your indexing flow, when you export data to a target, you can specify the target name (e.g. a database table name, a collection name, the node label in property graph databases, etc.) explicitly,
or for some backends you can also omit it and let CocoIndex generate a default name for you.
For the latter case, CocoIndex provides a utility function `cocoindex.utils.get_target_default_name()` to get the default name.
It takes the following arguments:

*   `flow` (type: `cocoindex.Flow`): The flow to get the default name for.
*   `target_name` (type: `str`): The export target name, appeared in the `export()` call.

For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
table_name = cocoindex.utils.get_target_default_name(text_embedding_flow, "doc_embeddings")
query = f"SELECT filename, text FROM {table_name} ORDER BY embedding <=> %s DESC LIMIT 5"
...
```
