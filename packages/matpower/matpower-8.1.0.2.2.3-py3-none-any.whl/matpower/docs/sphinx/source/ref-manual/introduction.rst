Introduction
============

The purpose of this *Reference Manual* is to provide reference documentation on each class and function in |MATPOWER|.

This documentation is automatically generated from the corresponding help text in the Matlab source for each function, class, property or method.

The GitHub icon in the upper right of each reference page links to the corresponding source file in the master branch on GitHub.

Currently, this manual includes *only* classes and functions that make up the new **MP-Core** and the **flexible** and **legacy** |MATPOWER| frameworks, but not the other legacy |MATPOWER| functions or the included packages |MPOM>|, |MIPS>|, |MPTEST>|, or |MOST>|.
