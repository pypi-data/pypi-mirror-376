Overview
========

..
    |MATPOWER| is a package of free, open-source Matlab-language M-files for solving steady-state power system simulation and optimization problems. It is built on |MPOM>|, a package for constructing and solving mathematical programming and optimization problems. |MPOM>| in turn relies on |MIPS>| (|MIPSname|) as a default solver. And |MOST>| (|MOSTname|), built on top of |MATPOWER|, is a framework for solving generalized steady-state electric power scheduling problems. All of them rely on |MPTEST>| as a software testing framework.


|MATPOWER| is a package of free, open-source Matlab-language functions and classes for simulating and optimizing steady-state power system problems. It includes the following sub-packages.

The documentation for |MATPOWER| can be found in the various Manuals, How To Guides, and Tech Notes on this site. Each function or class has its own reference documentation which can be accessed via the built-in ``help`` command in |MATLAB| or Octave, or by consulting the corresponding Reference manual.

Changes to |MATPOWER| in each released version are summarized in the `release notes <https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower/blob/master/docs/relnotes>`_, found on GitHub in ``docs/relnotes`` and in Appendix H of the |MUM|. A complete, detailed change log, even for unreleased versions, is available in the `CHANGES.md <https://github.com/MATPOWER/matpower/blob/master/CHANGES.md>`_ file.


.. note::

   The goal is to make all |MATPOWER| documentation available in HTML format, with some of the manuals also available as PDF. To facilitate this, new documentation is written in `reStructured Text <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/>`_ format for processing by `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_, so the HTML and PDF versions can be built from a single source.

   Currently, most of the User's Manuals are still only available as PDF, built from the legacy LaTeX source.
