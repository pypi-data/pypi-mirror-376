# crawler-user-agents

This repository contains a list of of HTTP user-agents used by robots, crawlers, and spiders as in single JSON file.

* NPM package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/crawler-user-agents>
* Go package: <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents>
* PyPi package: <https://pypi.org/project/crawler-user-agents/>

Each `pattern` is a regular expression. It should work out-of-the-box wih your favorite regex library.

## Install

### Direct download

Download the [`crawler-user-agents.json` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents/master/crawler-user-agents.json) from this repository directly.

### Javascript

crawler-user-agents is deployed on npmjs.com: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/crawler-user-agents>

To use it using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install --save crawler-user-agents
# OR
yarn add crawler-user-agents
```

In Node.js, you can `require` the package to get an array of crawler user agents.

```js
const crawlers = require('crawler-user-agents');
console.log(crawlers);
```

### Python

Install with `pip install crawler-user-agents`

Then:

```python
import crawleruseragents
if crawleruseragents.is_crawler("Googlebot/"):
   # do something
```

or:

```python
import crawleruseragents
indices = crawleruseragents.matching_crawlers("bingbot/2.0")
print("crawlers' indices:", indices)
print(
    "crawler's URL:",
    crawleruseragents.CRAWLER_USER_AGENTS_DATA[indices[0]]["url"]
)
```

Note that `matching_crawlers` is much slower than `is_crawler`, if the given User-Agent does indeed match any crawlers.

### Go

Go: use [this package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents),
  it provides global variable `Crawlers` (it is synchronized with `crawler-user-agents.json`),
  functions `IsCrawler` and `MatchingCrawlers`.

Example of Go program:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents"
)

func main() {
	userAgent := "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Discordbot/2.0; +https://discordapp.com)"

	isCrawler := agents.IsCrawler(userAgent)
	fmt.Println("isCrawler:", isCrawler)

	indices := agents.MatchingCrawlers(userAgent)
	fmt.Println("crawlers' indices:", indices)
	fmt.Println("crawler's URL:", agents.Crawlers[indices[0]].URL)
}
```

Output:

```
isCrawler: true
crawlers' indices: [237]
crawler' URL: https://discordapp.com
```

## Contributing

I do welcome additions contributed as pull requests.

The pull requests should:

* contain a single addition
* specify a discriminant relevant syntactic fragment (for example "totobot" and not "Mozilla/5 totobot v20131212.alpha1")
* contain the pattern (generic regular expression), the discovery date (year/month/day) and the official url of the robot
* result in a valid JSON file (don't forget the comma between items)

Example:

    {
      "pattern": "rogerbot",
      "addition_date": "2014/02/28",
      "url": "http://moz.com/help/pro/what-is-rogerbot-",
      "instances" : ["rogerbot/2.3 example UA"]
    }
