# Prompt 1: Initialize Project Structure

Create the initial project structure for PromptBin, a local-first prompt management tool. Set up:
1. A Python project with Flask as the web framework
2. File-based storage structure in ~/promptbin-data/ directory with subdirectories for coding/, writing/, and analysis/
3. Basic Flask app.py with routes for index, create, view, edit operations
4. Templates directory with base.html using HTMX
5. A requirements.txt with Flask, and other necessary dependencies
6. Basic CSS file in static/css/style.css

The app should run on localhost:5000 and use HTMX for dynamic interactions without full page reloads.
