# Prompt 12: Import/Export & Backup

Add import/export functionality:

1. Export all prompts as ZIP file with preserved directory structure
2. Export single prompt as JSON or Markdown
3. Import prompts from ZIP maintaining categories
4. Import validation to prevent overwriting without confirmation
5. Automatic backup system that creates timestamped backups
6. Version history by keeping old versions when prompts are edited
7. Bulk operations: delete multiple, move to category, export selected

Include progress indicators for bulk operations using HTMX.
